Simple comparisons and guides for **evidence synthesis tools**

## What this is for

There are many tools available for doing evidence synthesisâ€”tools for screening, de-duplicating, coding, visualising, and more. But choosing the right ones and understanding how they fit together can be confusing.

This repository helps by:

* Showing how each tool works, with examples.
* Explaining what each tool is good forâ€”and where it struggles.
* Providing shared code, templates, and training materials.
* Helping you combine tools into a common format for easier integration.

We donâ€™t build new tools hereâ€”we show how to **use** and **combine** existing ones.
