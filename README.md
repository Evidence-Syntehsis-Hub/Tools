Simple comparisons and guides for **evidence synthesis tools**

## What this is for

There are many tools available for doing evidence synthesis—tools for screening, de-duplicating, coding, visualising, and more. But choosing the right ones and understanding how they fit together can be confusing.

This repository helps by:

* Showing how each tool works, with examples.
* Explaining what each tool is good for—and where it struggles.
* Providing shared code, templates, and training materials.
* Helping you combine tools into a common format for easier integration.

We don’t build new tools here—we show how to **use** and **combine** existing ones.

## GitHub Pages

All documentation is published at: **[https://evidence-hub.org](https://evidence-hub.org)**

Each tool has its own page, including:

* What it does
* When to use it
* Pros & cons
* How to integrate with others

You can explore and contribute directly through that website. New content appears after each update to this repository.
