# Overview

This document compares three tools commonly used for screening and classifying papers in evidence synthesis workflows:

- **Colandr** – an open-source tool for systematic reviews including planning, screening, and extraction.
- **Abstrackr** – a semi-automated tool for abstract screening with machine learning.
- **GPT-based tagging** – a script-based approach using AI (e.g., OpenAI's GPT) to assign topics or filters to papers.

Each tool supports different stages of the evidence synthesis process. We explore when to use each, their strengths and limitations, and how they can complement one another.

# Tool Descriptions

## 🟦 Colandr

Colandr is a structured and collaborative tool covering the full systematic review process: from planning and protocol development to full-text screening and data extraction.

**Pros:**
- Centralizes review protocol, criteria, and inclusion logic
- Ideal for teamwork and coordination
- Handles full-text screening and data collection

**Cons:**
- No ML-assisted prioritization
- Limited filtering functions for large datasets
- Some usability bugs reported in large reviews

## 🟨 Abstrackr

Abstrackr is focused on the **screening phase** of a review. It uses machine learning to learn from user decisions and sort abstracts based on relevance.

**Pros:**
- Speeds up large reviews by moving likely relevant studies to the top
- Very simple interface
- No installation required

**Cons:**
- Doesn’t handle full-text or data extraction
- Requires clean import formats (e.g. RIS)
- Limited export structure for downstream use

## 🟧 GPT Tagging

GPT-based tagging uses a large language model (LLM) to automatically assign themes, tags, or labels to abstracts. This is useful for classifying papers across **multiple categories** once irrelevant ones have been filtered out.


**Pros:**
- Fast, accurate, and adaptable to new tag sets
- Ideal for thematic mapping, scoping reviews, or evidence gap mapping
- Can be effective at **filtering on metadata-like criteria** (e.g., geography or country mentions)

**Cons:**
- Cost can scale with the number of abstracts (token-based)
- Should not be used on unfiltered data to avoid waste
- Requires some scripting (R/Python)

# When to Use GPT Carefully

While GPT is powerful, it **should not replace screening**. Running GPT across all search results (thousands of records) would be costly and could propagate false positives.

That said, GPT can be **very effective at excluding a substantial portion of irrelevant papers** when your filtering criteria are simple and metadata-like — for example, geographic focus.

> If your criterion is "studies conducted in Africa," GPT can quickly identify papers that mention countries outside of Africa, allowing you to exclude a large number of irrelevant abstracts. This is especially useful after an initial ML screening phase has reduced the pool.

Use GPT:
- After deduplication and screening have removed obvious irrelevant records
- When you need to filter or tag based on geographic or topical filters (e.g., country, crop, method)
- For scoping reviews or mapping projects where quick categorization is useful

Always weigh the **cost vs benefit** of large-scale GPT use — especially with token-based pricing.

# Final Thoughts

No tool is perfect on its own. Here's how they best complement one another:

- **Abstrackr**: reduces the volume of manual screening
- **GPT**: adds speed and consistency to tagging, especially for high-impact filters like region or intervention
- **Colandr**: ensures quality, reproducibility, and team integration
