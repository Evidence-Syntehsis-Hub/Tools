# Overview

**Abstrackr** is a free, web-based tool designed to streamline the **title and abstract screening phase** of systematic reviews. It uses machine learning to predict which references are most likely to be relevant as you screen.

Abstrackr is especially useful when working with **large citation datasets**, allowing reviewers to focus effort where it matters most.

# Key Features

- Semi-automated abstract screening
- Learns from your inclusion/exclusion decisions
- Can prioritize articles for manual review
- Supports collaborative screening
- Works best with datasets of 200+ citations

# When to Use Abstrackr

Use Abstrackr when:

- You need to screen **hundreds or thousands of references**
- You want to **speed up** the process while retaining control
- You have **multiple reviewers**
- You want to prioritize screening for likely-includes

It is **not** used for full-text review or post-inclusion data extraction.

# How to Use Abstrackr

## 1. Create an Account

Go to [https://abstrackr.cebm.brown.edu](https://abstrackr.cebm.brown.edu) and sign up for a free account.

## 2. Create a New Project

- Name your review project
- Choose single or dual-screening mode
- Optionally, invite collaborators

## 3. Upload Citations

Supported formats include:

- `.RIS`
- `.TXT` (tagged citations)
- `.XML` (e.g., from EndNote or PubMed)

## 4. Begin Screening

- Mark each abstract as `Include`, `Exclude`, or `Unsure`
- You may also add reasons for exclusion if desired

## 5. Machine Learning in Action

- Abstrackr observes your screening decisions
- It updates its predictions after ~50â€“100 abstracts
- The more you screen, the more accurate the model becomes

## 6. Prioritize Screening

Once predictions are available, you can:

- Focus on high-likelihood `Includes`
- Stop early (if using active learning strategies)
- Export the final screened dataset

# Export Options

When finished, export your decisions as a `.CSV` file for:

- Documentation in PRISMA diagrams
- Loading into full-text screening tools (e.g., Covidence, CADIMA)
- Integration with other tools in your review pipeline
