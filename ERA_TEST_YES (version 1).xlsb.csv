NN0334,"Survival analysis applying proportional hazards models was used to investigate genetic and non-genetic factors affecting ewe longevity and lamb survival of sheep in Ethiopia. Data were obtained from an on-station closed nucleus breeding program of Menz sheep and an on-farm Awassi x Menz sheep crossbreeding project. A total of 695 ewes and 1890 lambs born from the nucleus population of Menz sheep were used for the analysis of ewe productive life and lamb survival to yearling age respectively. In addition, 5530 lamb records of purebred local and crossbreds with proportions of similar to 25-50% Awassi, collected from three locations were used for the analysis of lamb survival from birth to weaning age. The effects of year, ewe parity and litter weight at weaning were significant (p < 0.05) for ewe productive life. On-station lamb survival to yearling was affected by year and breeding value of yearling weight of the lamb, indicating that faster growing animals had substantially higher survival rates. Animal model heritability estimates for lamb mortality ranged from 0.02 to 0.10. While there was a strong genetic trend for growth rate, as evidenced by estimated breeding values for different birth years, estimated breeding values for lamb survival were variable across years with decreasing trend. These results indicate no antagonism between growth rate and survival under conditions prevailing in the nucleus system. Routine genetic evaluation for survival is suggested. Under farmer conditions, the effects of year, season, sex and location effects were significant (p < 0.05) on lamb survival to weaning age whereas breed composition (local versus crossbred) of dam as well as of the lamb were not significant. This seems to indicate that crossbreeding of local animals with Awassi sheep does not have an adverse effect on the survival of lambs under farmer conditions typical for the Ethiopian highland regions included in this study.

LM0205,"The effects of crop manure and inorganic fertilizers on composition of microbial communities of central high land soils of Kenya are poorly known. For this reason, we have carried out a thirty-two-year-old long-term trial in Kabete, Kenya. These soils were treated with organic (maize stover (MS) at 10 t ha(-1), farmyard manure (FYM) at 10 t ha(-1)) and inorganic fertilizers 120 kg N, 52.8 kg P (N(2)P(2)), N(2)P(2) + MS, N(2)P(2) + FYM, a control, and a fallow for over 30 years. We examined 16S rRNA gene and 28S rRNA gene fingerprints of bacterial and fungal diversity by PCR amplification and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis separation, respectively. The PCR bacterial community structure and diversity were negatively affected by N(2)P(2) and were more closely related to the bacterial structure in the soils without any addition (control) than that of soils with a combination of inorganic and organic or inorganic fertilizers alone. The effect on fungal diversity by N(2)P(2) was different than the effect on bacterial diversity since the fungal diversity was similar to that of the N(2)P(2) + FYM and N(2)P(2) + MS-treated. However, soils treated with organic inputs clustered away from soils amended with inorganic inputs. Organic inputs had a positive effect on both bacterial and fungal diversity with or without chemical fertilizers.

NJ0139,"Several interrelated and site-specific agronomic factors ranging from agroecological conditions to systems management practices have been shown to variably affect arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) diversity in the soil. Also, there have been various attempts in the past to evaluate the potential of AMF field inoculation but a majority focussed on the use of exotic strains, disregarding the potential of the existing naturally occurring strains. In an attempt to address these problems, our study aimed to develop 'best-bet practice' based on soil fertility amendment practice (SFAP) that encourages occurrence and diversity of AMF in the soil. Control treatment (no application) was compared with three (3) SFAP used singly or in combination with AMF or two other soil nutrients enhancing organisms (Bacillus and Trichoderma) which included the following: (1) Mavuno (macro- and micronutrients and secondary nutrients) fertilizer, (2) calcium ammonium nitrate (CAN) plus triple super phosphate (TSP) and (3) cattle manure. Maize (Zea mays L.) and common bean (Phaseoli vulgaris L.) were planted at on-station and on-farm plots for two consecutive cropping seasons with the experiment replicated in two benchmark sites of Embu and Taita-Taveta Districts. Embu site recorded a lower soil pH and also very low phosphorus levels compared to Taita site. The number of AMF spores per kg of soil was very low, ranging from 30 to 100, at Embu in the first season and application of SFAP resulted in no significant difference. However, in the second season, use of Trichoderma + CAN plus TSP was shown to significantly stimulate AMF species in the soil, with a 250 % increase in species density compared to use of Bacillus + Manure. At Taita, after the first cropping season, significant change in spore density was only recorded from AMF applied singly with a 66.1 % increase in spore density compared to Control treatment. In comparison, after the second cropping season, use of AMF applied singly, AMF + CAN plus TSP and AMF + Manure increased spore density by 135.4, 109.6 and 100 % respectively compared to Control treatment. Use of AMF applied singly increased species density in the soil by 100 and 81.1 % compared to CAN plus TSP and Trichoderma treatments respectively after first season at Taita site: while after the second cropping season, application of AMF + CAN plus TSP, AMF + Manure and AMF + Mavuno increased AMF species density in the soil by 60.3, 51.5 and 55.9 % respectively compared to Control treatment.

AN0032,"The moist savanna zone covers 0.5 x 10 6 km 2 in West Africa and is characterized by very low soil N levels limiting primary production, but the ecology of nitrifiers in these (agro)ecosystems is largely unknown. We compared the effects of six agricultural practices on nitrifier activity, abundance and diversity at nine sites in central Ivory Coast. Treatments, including repeated fertilization with ammonium and urea, had no effect on nitrification and crop N status after 3 to 5 crop cycles. Nitrification was actually higher at low than medium ammonium level. The nitrifying community was always dominated by ammonia oxidizing archaea and Nitrospira. However, the abundances of ammonia oxidizing bacteria, AOB, and Nitrobacter increased with fertilization after 5 crop cycles. Several AOB populations, some affiliated to Nitrosospira strains with urease activity or adapted to fluctuating ammonium levels, emerged in fertilized plots, which was correlated to nitrifying community ability to benefit from fertilization. In these soils, dominant nitrifiers adapted to very low ammonium levels have to be replaced by high-N nitrifiers before fertilization can stimulate nitrification. Our results show that the delay required for this replacement is much longer than ever observed for other terrestrial ecosystems, i.e. > 5 crop cycles, and demonstrate for the first time that nitrifier characteristics jeopardize the efficiency of fertilization in moist savanna soils. © 2017 The Author(s).",Ivory Coast,Ivory Coast,Ivory Coast,TRUE,,"Maize, Common Bean-Maize, Maize-Soybean",NA,NA,TRUE,,"Mulch, Inorganic Fertilizer, Crop Rotation-Mulch, Crop Rotation","inorganic fertilizers, organic fertilizers","fertilization with ammonium, fertilization with urea",Inorganic Fertilizers,TRUE,,TRUE,,Resilience,Physical,Biodiversity,Beneficial Organisms,"nitrifier activity, nitrifier abundance, nitrifier diversity, crop nitrogen status",Nitrogen Agronomic Efficiency,beneficial organisms,TRUE,,FALSE,major
LM0004,"Systematic exportation, burning of crop residues and decreases in fallow periods have led to a large-scale depletion of soil organic matter and degradation of soil fertility in the cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) cropping systems of Cameroon. The present study tested whether soil management systems based on a no-till with mulch approach intercropped with cereals, which has been shown to restore cotton production, could boost the biological activity of soil macrofauna. The impacts of no tillage with grass mulch (Brachiaria ruziziensis Germain and Eward) (NTG) and no tillage with legume mulch (Crotalaria retusa L. or Mucuna pruriens Bak.) (NTL) on the abundance, diversity and functional role of soil invertebrates were evaluated during the third year of implementation in northern Cameroon (Winde and Zouana), compared to conventional tillage (CT) and no tillage (NT) without mulch. Macrofauna were sampled from two 30 cm x 30 cm soil cubes (including litter) at the seeding stage of cotton, and 30 days later. The collected organisms were grouped into detritivores, herbivores and predators. Examination of the soil macrofauna patterns revealed that the abundance and diversity of soil arthropods were significantly higher in NTG and NTL than in CT plots (+103 and +79%, respectively), while that of NT plots was in-between the no tillage groups and CT (+37%). Regarding major ecological functions, herbivores and predators were significantly more abundant in NTG and NTL plots than in CT plots at Winde (+168 and +180%, respectively), while detritivores, predators and herbivores were significantly more abundant in the NTG plots than in CT plots at Zouana (+92, +517 and +116%, respectively). Formicidae (53.6%), Termitidae (24.7%) and Lumbricidae (9.4%) were the most abundant detritivores while Julidae (46.1 %), Coleoptera larvae (22.1 %) and Pyrrhocoridae or Reduviidae (11.8%) were the dominant herbivores. The major constituents of the predatory group were Araneae (33.8%), Carabidae (24.6%), Staphylinidae (15.7%) and Scolopendridae (10.3%).

DK0089,"Unravelling how earthworms and ants are deterministically structured by abiotic and biotic factors is of utmost relevance in fostering favourable environments for their increased abundance and action, more so in the increasingly degraded agricultural ecosystems of mountainous regions in sub-Saharan Africa. The Mount Elgon region (MER) of Uganda is characterised by mosaics of farmlands dominated by Arabica coffee with variability in inclusion of companion crops and shade trees, and in use of organic and inorganic fertilizers; and elevation. In this paper we explored abundance of soil macrofauna and microclimate patterns in different cropping systems at varying mountain elevations. The study covered 72 coffee fields delineated by 3 elevation categories: low, mid and high; and 4 cropping systems: Coffee monocrop (C), Coffee + annual crop (C + A), coffee + banana (C + B), and coffee + banana + shade trees (C + B + T). Results indicated that ant abundance at high elevation was thrice that of low and was same order of magnitude in unshaded than in banana- and tree-shaded systems. Earthworm abundance followed a different trend, decreasing with altitude except in C + B and C + A systems. Some of these relationships could be explained by ambient temperature, light intensity and soil electrical conductivity in the systems. Earthworms preferred less-illuminated shaded coffee systems at warmer low-mid elevations and soils with relatively high electrical conductivity whereas ants' counts were depressed by such systems, and mostly driven by cooler higher elevations.

HK0206,"The study investigated diversity and frequency of occurrence of glomale (Arbuscular- or Vesicular Arbuscular-) mycorrhizal fungi on three farming systems in a drought prone and nitrogen deficiency site in southern Malawi. The farming systems comprised of two agroforestry systems of Sesbania sesban (L) Merr intercropped with maize and Sesbania macrantha E Phillips & Hutch. intercropped with maize and a maize monocrop systems without fertilizer, with nitrogen, phosphorus and a combination of nitrogen and phosphorus. Species diversity and species frequency of occurrence were examined in soil samples obtained in the dry and wet seasons. Twelve glomale mycorrhizal species were recorded, four species being in the genus Acaulospora, four in Glomus, two in Gigaspora and two in Scutellospora. Species diversity in the two agroforestry systems were not significantly (p <= 0.05) different but had lower species diversity than maize monocrop with only Sesbania macrantha intercropped with maize significantly (p <= 0.05) lower. Species diversity was significantly increased by the inorganic nitrogen fertilizer. Inorganic phosphorus fertilizer had no effect. The study shows that the occurrence and persistence of glomale species are influenced by agroforestry combinations, and that the spores of most species are tolerant to dry conditions.

HK0003,"The increased use of cereal/legume crop rotation has been advocated as a strategy to increase cereal yields of subsistence farmers in West Africa, and is believed to promote changes in the rhizosphere that enhance early plant growth. In this study we investigated the microbial diversity of the rhizoplane from seedlings grown in two soils previously planted to cereal or legume from experimental plots in Gaya, Niger, and Kaboli, Togo. Soils from these legume rotation and continuous cereal plots were placed into containers and sown in a growth chamber with maize (Zea mays L.), millet (Pennisetum glaucum L.), sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L. Moench.), cowpea (Vigna unguiculata L.) or groundnut (Arachis hypogaea L.). At 7 and 14 days after sowing, 16S rDNA profiles of the eubacterial and ammonia-oxidizing communities from the rhizoplane and bulk soil were generated using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). Community profiles were subjected to peak fitting analyses to quantify the DNA band position and intensities, after which these data were compared using correspondence and principal components analysis. The, data showed that cropping system had a highly significant effect on community structure (p < 0.005), irrespective of plant species or sampling time. Continuous cereal-soil grown plants had highly similar rhizoplane communities across crop species and sites, whereas communities from the rotation soil showed greater variability and clustered with respect to plant species.

NN0040,"The use of crop residues as surface mulches has been shown to have a beneficial effect on the growth of pearl millet [Pennisetum glaucum (L.) R.Br.] in the Sahelian zone of West Africa. This study was conducted to discern the mechanism(s) responsible for yield increases resulting from crop-residue additions in a field trial located on a sandy soil at the ICRISAT Sahelian Center near Niamey, Niger. Soil chemical and physical properties were examined to a depth of 120 cm after 5 yr of application of millet residue as a surface mulch, P and N fertilizer, or a combination of fertilizer and residue. Annual residue application resulted in a higher exchangeable-base content, lower Al saturation, and slightly higher available-P values than the control. The use of fertilizer resulted in an increase in available P and exchangeable Ca. The combination of residue plus fertilizer resulted in greater enhancement of soil fertility parameters than the use of these inputs alone. Differences in soil chemistry were operative in only the top 20 cm of the soil profile, however, the surfaces of the plots receiving residues were 15 to 20 cm higher than the surfaces of the control and fertilizer-only plots. The surfaces of the residue plots also had lower clay contents than the surface soils in the nonresidue plots. The increase in soil fertility following the application of millet residue as a surface mulch was due to two mechanisms:; (i) the recycling of nutrient elements to the soil following termite and microbial decomposition of the residue, and (ii) the entrapment of eolian materials, which generally have better fertility characteristics than the subsoil, or protection of the more fertile surface soil from the erosive effects of the strong winds that are common in the Sahel.",Niger,Niger,Niger,TRUE,,Pearl Millet,pearl millet,pearl millet,TRUE,,"Inorganic Fertilizer, Mulch, Inorganic Fertilizer-Mulch","mulch,inorganic fertilizers","surface mulching, surface residue application, nitrogen and phosphorus fertilization","Mulch, Inorganic Fertilizers",TRUE,,TRUE,,Resilience,Physical,Soil Quality,"Cation Exchange Capacity, Soil Organic Carbon","increase in exchangeable-base content, lower Al saturation, higher available-P values, increase in soil fertility, increase in soil profile height, entrapment of eolian materials, protection from wind erosion","Soil Organic Carbon, Soil Total Nitrogen","available P, cation exchange capacity",TRUE,,FALSE,major

Results showed a significant polyphenolic content decrease of 99% and a noticeable transformation of low to high molecular weight fraction during the compost maturation period. During this step, polyphenols disappearance suggested their assimilation by thermophilic bacteria as a carbon and energy source, and contributed to humic substances synthesis.

DK0145,"Soil degradation and salinization caused by inappropriate cultivation practices and high levels of saltwater intrusion are having an adverse effect on agriculture in Central Senegal. The residues of Piliostigma reticulatum, a local shrub that coexists with crops, were recently shown to increase particulate organic matter and improve soil quality and may be a promising means of alleviating the effects of salinization. This study compared the effects of inorganic fertilizer and P. reticulatum residues on microbial properties and the ability of soil to withstand salinity stress. We hypothesized that soils amended with P. reticulatum would be less affected by salinity stress than soils amended with inorganic fertilizer and control soil. Salinity stress was applied to soil from a field site that had been cultivated for 5 years under a millet/peanut crop rotation when microbial biomass, phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) community profile, catabolic diversity, microbial activities were determined. Microbial biomass, nitrification potential and dehydrogenase activity were higher by 20%, 56% and 69% respectively in soil with the organic amendment. With salinity stress, the structure and activities of the microbial community were significantly affected. Although the biomass of actinobacteria community increased with salinity stress, there was a substantial reduction in microbial activity in all soils. The soil organically amended was, however, less affected by salinity stress than the control or inorganic fertilizer treatment. This suggests that amendment using P. reticulatum residues may improve the ability of soils to respond to saline conditions. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

NN0048,"Wind erosion in the Southern Sahelian Zone occurs during short monsoon storms preceding rainfall events and leads to crop damage and loss of fertile topsoil. A survey with farmers was conducted near the ICRISAT Sahelian Centre (ISC) at Niamey, Niger, in older to learn about their knowledge of wind erosion and their strategies to reduce the wind erosion damage. Although 66% of the farmers have noticed wind erosion on their own fields within the last decade, it was not considered a main concern. Wind erosion caused inconveniences to millet according to 69% of the surveyed. Wind erosion changed the topography and decreased soil fertility, which resulted in spots with increased wind erosion damage within their fields. Farmers in the region have developed a strategy to deal with the restoration of these spots and used organic matter such as stover from more productive spots for mulching. A field experiment was conducted at ISC during 1991 to assess the effects of 3 year-old Andropogon gayanus and Bauhinia rufescens windbreaks and of a crop residue application (2 t ha(-1)) on the quantity of eroded soil. A. gayanus and B. rufescens reduced the soil flux by 24% and 58%, respectively. Crop residues decreased soil nux by 59%. Maximum protection was given by a combination of both control measures. Control measures like windbreaks are difficult to establish and farmers have good reasons to use crop residues elsewhere. Thus, solutions must be found in close cooperation with farmers.

The four systems tested consisted of the following:; pure stand of maize (Zea mays) (T 1), maize intercropped with Mucuna pruriens (T2), maize plus Vicia benghalensis (T3), and maize plus Lablab purpureus (T4). Measurements taken included runoff, soil loss, percent crop cover and analysis of nutrients in the original soil and eroded sediments. Cumulative soil loss recorded during 1999 long rain season ranged from 58.64 to 61.7 t ha(-1). At the onset of the 1999 short rain season, soil loss was significantly different between treatments (P""0.05). This was attributed to post-harvest crop cover provided by the legume cover crops grown from the previous season.

NN0063,"Mulching for wind erosion control in Sahelian farming systems is limited by low biomass production and use of crop residues for other purposes. The aim of this study was to test the effectiveness in soil protection created by two low amounts of crop residues. A field experiment was conducted in southwest Niger, on a Psammentic Paleustalf (sandy, siliceous, isohyperthermic) during the early rainy seasons of 1994 and 1995. Particle mass transport was quantified in two plots of 55 by 70 m. During the first storms of both seasons, the plots were without a mulch cover. Afterward, one plot was covered with nat pearl millet [Pennisetum glaucum (L.) R. Pr.] stalks. The application rates were 1500 and 1000 kg ha(-1) during the first and second seasons, respectively. To quantify the mulch effect, mass transport rate differences between the two bare plots were quantified with a multiple linear regression model (R-2 = 0.89), using wind speed (7.4-12.3 m s(-1)), wind direction, and storm duration (464-3835 s). Total mass transport rates were reduced from 365.2 to 132.9 g m(-1) s(-1) (63.6%) with 1500 kg ha(-1), and from 325.1 to 188.0 g m(-1) s(-1) (42.2%) with 1000 kg ha(-1) of crop residues. Soil protection tended to decrease with increasing wind speed. Linear regression indicated that the reduction in mass transport becomes zero at wind speeds of 11.1 and 16.0 m s(-1) for the 1000 and 1500 kg ha(-1) covers, respectively, The 1000 kg ha(-1) cover even enhanced sediment transport by 6.5% during one storm with a nind speed of 11.3 m s(-1). The 1500 kg ha(-1) mulch cover reduced sediment transport from 49.7 to 80.2% during five storms with wind speeds varying from 8.3 to 10.6 m s(-1), and is therefore recommended as the better application rate for wind erosion control in the Sahel.",Niger,Niger,Niger,TRUE,,Pearl Millet,Pennisetum glaucum,Pennisetum glaucum,TRUE,,Mulch,mulch,"mulching, wind erosion control","Mulch, Wind Erosion Control",FALSE,minor,FALSE,minor,Resilience,Physical,Soil Quality,Erosion,"soil protection, sediment transport reduction, crop residue effectiveness",soil erosion,soil loss,TRUE,,TRUE,
LM0342,"RUSLE, the revised universal soil loss equation, is widely used for estimating potential soil erosion by water. Field measured model factors are however scarce for tropical regions. We derived RUSLE factors for several soil conservation measures based on three seasons of field plot measurements (2008-2010), in two contrasting landscape units of South Eastern Tanzania, the country's most important cashew growing area. Whereas the derived factors are useful for applying RUSLE in similar environments, this study points to the importance of understanding differences between soil types and landscape units when assessing potential soil erosion. On the Makonde plateau, rainfall erosivity was higher than on the inland plains (7,130 vs 5,783 MJmmha -1 h-1 year-1). The soil erodility K factor was also higher (0.014th MJ-1mm-1) on the sandy Cutanic Acrisols of the Makonde plateau than on the clayey Acric Ferralsols (0.006th MJ-1mm-1) of the inland plains. Likewise, soil loss on the Makonde plateau was much higher than on the inland plain (e. g. for maize 33-127 t ha-1 season-1 vs 3-10 t ha-1 season-1). The differences between the C factor for ""maize"", and for ""maize with crop residues"", as well as the differences between the P factors for ""lemon grass strips"" and ""ridges and furrows"" indicate that although soils of the Makonde plateau are more susceptible to soil erosion, these soils are also more responsive to soil conservation measures compared to soils of the inland plains. Farmers' local technique of making ""ridges and furrows"" is particularly effective. Furthermore, the C factors for cashew groves are one order of magnitude lower (0.08-0.09) than for ""maize"", or for ""maize with crop residues"" (0.2-0.7), but are still much higher than for ""bush fallow"" (0.001). Deforestation for agriculture hence bears the risk of increasing soil erosion rates; however, this risk can be minimised by growing cashew trees. © 2013 Gebr.

A field experiment was conducted on a Ferric Lixisol in Burkina Faso to assess the effects of soil and water conservation barriers (stone rows or grass strips of Andropogon gayanus), the sole use of organic (compost) or mineral (urea) source of nitrogen (N), and the combined use of barriers and compost or urea nitrogen on soil nutrient and sediment erosion. The run-off barriers were put along contours. Organic carbon (OC) and nutrients losses through run-off and sediments were monitored during 2001 and 2002. Carbon and nutrient concentrations of generated sediments were very high, of 14-29gkg-1 OC, 1.0-3.7gkg-1N and 0.32-0.71gkg-1 total P.

Annual losses of organic C, N, P, and K were high and greatly dependant on soil loss magnitude. Compared to the control plots, soil losses were reduced on average by 84% during the 2 years with stone rows treatments, while by 71% with grass strips treatments. Compost application reduced soil loss by 75% in plots without barriers and by 89% in plots with stone rows as compared to control plots.

AN0078,"The implementation of soil and water conservation (SWC) measures in the Ethiopian Highlands is a top priority to reduce soil erosion rates. However, the effectiveness of these measures for different hillslope gradients and land use conditions remains poorly understood. This study addresses this knowledge gap by determining support practice (P) and cover-management (C) factors of the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation for commonly used SWC structures in semi-arid environments. The factor values were calculated on the basis of soil loss data collected with 21 large runoff plots installed in rangeland and cropland sites. The P-and C-factors were calculated following the recommended procedures. Results show P-factors ranging from 0.32 to 0.74 for stone bunds, from 0.07 to 0.65 for trenches, and from 0.03 to 0.22 for stone bunds with trenches. Reduced storage capacities due to sediment deposition resulted in significant declines of the effectiveness of SWC structures over time. For example, the average P-factor value for trenches increased from 0.1 in the first year after installation to 0.51 after 3 years. C-factor values ranged from 0.23 to 0.82 in rangeland and from 0.03 to 0.35 in cropland. For rangeland, this large variability is due to vegetation cover changes caused by grazing. In cropland, C-factors vary with crop types and tillage practices.

DK0088,"Farmers possess a wealth of knowledge regarding soil erosion and soil and water conservation (SWC), and there is a great demand to access it. However, there has been little effort to systematically document farmers' experiences and perceptions of SWC measures. Sustainable Land Management (SLM) has largely evolved through local traditional practices rather than adoption based on scientific evidence. This research aimed to assess soil erosion and performance of different SWC measures from the farmers' perspective by documenting their perceptions and experiences in Koga catchment, Ethiopia. To this aim, workshops were organised in three sub-catchments differing in slopes and SWC measures. Workshops included group discussions and field monitoring of erosion indicators and systematically describing the status of soil erosion, soil fertility and yield to assess the performance of SWC measures. Results show that farmers are aware of the harmful effects of ongoing soil erosion and of the impacts of mitigation measures on their farms. Sheet erosion was found to be the most widespread form of erosion while rill damage was critical on plots cultivated to cereals on steep slopes. The average rill erosion rates were 24.2 and 47.3 t/ha/y in treated and untreated farmlands, respectively. SWC reduced rill erosion on average by more than 48%. However, the impacts of SWC measures varied significantly between sub-watersheds, and farmers believed that SWC measures did not prevent erosion completely. Comparatively, graded stone-faced soil bunds revealed maximum desired impacts and were most appreciated by farmers, whereas level bunds caused water logging. Most traditional ditches were highly graded and begun incising and affected production of cereals. Despite the semi-quantitative nature of the methodology, using farmers' perceptions and experiences to document land degradation and the impacts of SWC measures is crucial as they are the daily users of the land and therefore directly affecting the success or failure of SWC measures.

DK0113,"Developing countries with an increasing population like Ethiopia experience degradation of land and water resources. To tackle this problem soil and water conservation (SWC) has been practiced and recently promoted by the Ethiopian government. However, the effectiveness of SWC practices on runoff and soil erosion have not been studied in detail for their long- and short-term effects. An integrated measurement and modeling study was conducted from 2012 to 2014 in the Gumara-Maksegnit sub watershed to assess the impacts of SWC structures on runoff and sediment yield using the Geospatial Interface for the Water Erosion Prediction Project (GeoWEPP) model. The study was conducted in two adjacent, smaller watersheds where SWC structures were constructed in one of the watersheds (treated sub watershed), while the other one was a control watershed without SWC structures (untreated sub watershed). The treated sub watershed has an area of 27.1 ha and the untreated sub watershed has an area of 31.7 ha. Runoff and sediment yield were compared based on the observations and GeoWEPP model simulations. The GeoWEPP model simulation results predicted the daily runoff satisfactorily for both sub watersheds (R-2 = 0.68 and NSE = 0.43 for untreated and R-2 = 0.61 and NSE = 0.84 for treated sub watershed). Similarly, the model prediction showed satisfactory results in sediment yield (R-2 = 0.61 and NSE = 0.59 for untreated and R-2 = 0.57 and NSE = 0.81 for treated sub watershed). SWC structures reduced slope gradient and changed flow accumulation. The observation and simulation study concluded that the treated sub watershed surface runoff was reduced by about 19% as compared to the untreated sub watershed. Similarly, the model estimated that SWC structures constructed in the treated sub watershed reduced the total area that generates soil loss above the set target limit of 10 t ha(-1) y(-1) t from 49% to 38% of the watershed area. SWC has led to a significant reduction in sediment yield by 28 to 38% in these highland watersheds of Ethiopia.

EO0061,"This study assesses the interrelationships between terrace development and topographic factors, soil erosion, and soil dislocation by tillage in Minchet Catchment in the Ethiopian Highlands. Data were collected through a mix of modelling soil erosion using the Universal Soil Loss Equation adapted to Ethiopia, and measuring slope and soil deposition above the terraces. The terraces, which developed over 29years following construction of fanya juu bunds on cropland, reduced the cropland's current slope gradient to half of its original slope, leading to about 39% less soil erosion. Currently, of the total 50tha(-1)yr(-1) soil deposition measured above the terraces, about 22tha(-1)yr(-1) was soil eroded by water, and the other 28tha(-1)yr(-1) was soil that had been dislocated by tillage. This shows that Soil and Water Conservation technologies in the study area are effective in reducing slope gradient and slope length, and thus also in trapping eroded soil, slowing soil movement by tillage, and ultimately, in reducing soil erosion.

LM0305,"Land degradation and recurrent drought are the major threats to rain-fed agriculture in the semi-arid Ethiopian highlands. Water harvesting has become a priority in the Tigray region since 1990. However, the success of water harvesting in reservoirs is limited due to reduced inflow. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of typical land-use types, slope gradients, and different soil and water conservation (SWC) structures on runoff and soil loss at the runoff-plot scale. Six runoff measuring sites, corresponding to three slope gradients, were established for cropland (cultivated land for annual crop production) and rangeland (heavily grazed land on hillslopes with high rock-fragment cover) at Mayleba catchment in Tigray, Ethiopia. SWC structures tested were stone bunds, trenches, and stone bunds with trenches, in addition to control plots. In total, 21 large runoff plots (with lengths of 60 to 100 m) were monitored daily for runoff production and soil loss during the main rainy season (July-September) in 2010. The results show that the seasonal runoff coefficient (RCs) representing the fraction of rainfall measured as runoff was much higher for rangeland (0.38 < RCs < 0.50) compared to that for cropland (0.11 < RCS < 0.15). Seasonal soil loss (SLs) values were five to six times larger on rangeland (28.6 < SLs < 50.0 ton ha-1) compared to that for cropland (4.6 < SLs < 11.4 ton ha-1). Stone bunds with trenches were the most effective SWC structures in reducing runoff and soil loss. With the same SWC structures installed, RCs and SLs for both rangeland and cropland tend to decrease with increasing slope gradient mainly due to a corresponding increase in rock-fragment cover. The effects of SWC structures on runoff production and soil loss are considerable; hence, it is crucial to consider these effects for optimal design of water-harvesting schemes such as micro-dams that collect and store surface runoff for irrigation development in the Ethiopian highlands. © 2013 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",Ethiopia,Ethiopia,Ethiopia,TRUE,,Fodder (Natural Vegetation),"rain-fed agriculture, annual crops, rangeland",NA,FALSE,minor,Water Harvesting,water harvesting,"water harvesting, soil and water conservation structures (stone bunds, trenches)",Water Harvesting,TRUE,,TRUE,,Resilience,Physical,Soil Quality,Erosion,"seasonal runoff coefficient, seasonal soil loss, runoff production, soil loss","runoff, soil loss","seasonal runoff coefficient, seasonal soil loss, runoff production, soil loss",TRUE,,TRUE,

This study concerns a comparison of erosion between monoculture and polyculture systems, and an assessment of the planting practices in reducing erosion under monoculture. The results from monitoring soil loss on six run-off plots show that soil erosion increases when traditional cassava polyculture is changed to monoculture practices.

HK0278,"An increased public perception of the role of agriculture in non-point source pollution has stimulated the need for information on the effect of conventional and sustainable agricultural management systems on water quality. While information on run-off and soil erosion is readily available in Zimbabwe, there is dearth of knowledge on the relative losses of nutrients as a result of soil erosion and their effect on water quality. This study sought to quantify the amount of nutrients lost as a result of soil erosion and thus enable conclusions to be drawn on the implications on water quality. Research work was carried out in the semi-arid region of Zimbabwe under granite-derived, inherently infertile sandy soils. Soil erosion was quantified under three tillage systems conventional tillage (CT); mulch ripping (MR); tied ridging (TR) over three years. Run-off and sediments were analysed for N, P and K. The results showed that N and K losses were significantly higher (p < 0.00 1) under CT (15.8 and 34.5 kg ha(-1) yr(-1) respectively) compared to the MR (2.3 and 0. 6 kg ha(-1) yr(-1) respec tively) and TR (2.7 and 4.3 kg ha(-1) yr(-1) respectively). Due to the immobility of P and its small quantities in these soils, P losses were also low across all treatments (<I kg ha(-1) yr(-1)), however CT had significantly higher losses (p < 0.001). The study showed that CT results in high losses of nutrients, which would in turn reduce the quality of surface waters, due to high nutrient concentrations of especially, N, which stimulates the growth of algae and other aquatic weeds. The gravity of the situation would be higher, where soils are more fertile. MR and TR were efficient in reducing soil erosion and thus nutrient losses with run-off and sediments.

CA practices were introduced in fields with Vertisols in a randomized complete block design on permanent 5 x 19 m plots. Three treatments were evaluated:; (1) conventional tillage (CT) with a minimum of three tillage operations and removal of crop residues, (2) terwah (TER) that was similar to CT except that contour furrows were included at 1.5 m intervals, and (3) derdero+ (DER+), which consists of permanent raised beds with a furrow and bed system, retention of 30% of standing crop residues and zero tillage on the top of the bed.

The impact of these techniques on runoff, soil loss, crop yield and biomass production is measured at on-farm experimental sites in seven research sites under different a,oro-ecological conditions. On one hand, most measures brought about a considerable reduction in soil loss and runoff. The latter, however, increases the waterlogging hazard, particularly in sub-humid environments. On the other hand, crop yield and biomass production did not increase, as it would have been necessary to compensate for the high costs of soil conservation.

EO0080,"The effects of supplementing Moringa oleifera leaf meal (MOLM) and molasses to grain sorghum based diets on performance of growing chicks was studied in a 2x3 factorial design for 8 weeks. The study used two grain sorghum varieties: high (HTS) and low (LTS) tannin; three supplementary strategies of non-supplemented, 10% DM- molasses and 10% DM-MOLM to make six diets, CTL1, SCM2., MOL1 and CTL2, SCM2 and MOL2 respectively. Survival, colour of body parts, growth parameters and feed conversion ratio were not influenced by type of sorghum. The DMI was higher in HTS and leg abnormality incidence (LAI) was higher in LTS. Survival and growth parameters were not influenced by type of supplementation. The supplementation of molasses aggravated, while supplementation of MOLM prevented, occurrence of LAI. The birds fed molasses showed paleness but those fed MOLM showed yellowing of body parts. The DMI and FCR were better in birds fed CTL1 compared with fed CTL2 based diets. Supplementation of molasses and MOLM improved DMI and FCR in HTS compared with LTS. HTS based diets in growing chicks should be supplemented with energy sources, minerals and pigments; while LTS based diets should be supplemented with minerals and pigments. Sugar cane molasses improves FCR in HTS but requires supplementation of minerals and pigments.Use of molasses as an additive to LTS based could impair FCR and aggravate LAI and is not recommended.

DK0060,"Scarcity of plant available water is a major challenge for rainfed agriculture throughout the Sahel. At two longterm experiments in Central and Southern Senegal, optimized intercropping with native woody shrubs, Piliostigma reticulatum (DC.) Hochst or Guiera senegalensis J.F. Gmel, (elevated densities and annual coppiced biomass returned to soils) have shown significant improvement of soil-plant-water relations, nutrient availability, and crop yields. The objective was to investigate soil physical properties to develop a mechanistic understanding for the observed improvement of water dynamics due to optimized shrub intercropping. The field experiments had a split-plot factorial design with shrubs as the main factor and fertilizer rate (0, 0.5, 1.0. 1.5 times the recommended addition of N-P-K fertilizer) as the subplot factor. This experiment was carried out at the sites of Keur Matar Arame (Keur Matar) with G. senegalensis and Nioro du Rip (Nioro) with P. re:Lc-alai:um. Water retention characteristic, unsaturated hydraulic conductivity, surface evaporation, and surface infiltration were measured in the zero fertilizer treatment. At Keur Matar samples were collected from crop + shrub plots near ( < 0.5 m) the shrub canopy (CSn), crop + shrub plots far ( > 1 m) from the canopy (CSf) and in crop only plots (CO). At Nioro samples were taken in CSn, CSf, CO, and also from bare soil with no crops or shrubs growing (BS). Infiltration in CO plots compared to CSn plots was 75% and 28% higher at Keur Matar and Nioro, respectively.

NJ0084,"Moderation of soil disturbance following tillage operations using external inputs, particularly organic manures, is becoming an important aspect of soil tillage management. This study examined the effects of tillage, poultry manure (PM) and NPK fertiliser on soil physical properties and their relationship with maize yield. The experiment was a split-split-plot design with three replications. Tillage (zero tillage (ZT), minimum tillage (MT) and conventional tillage (CT)) was the main plot, the subplot contained four NPK fertiliser treatments (0, 90, 120 and 150 kg N ha(-1)), and the sub-subplots comprised three PM treatments (0, 10 and 20 Mg ha(-1)). The soil texture was gravelly loamy sand. Soil bulk density (B-D), total porosity (Pt), clay dispersion ratio (CDR) and saturated hydraulic conductivity (K-s) were evaluated. Samples for B-D and K-s were collected from the soil surface using stainless cylindrical soil core (5 cm in diameter and 5 cm in height), whereas samples for CDR determination were collected at 0-20 cm soil depth. Compared with the ZT, significantly lower B-D was obtained under CT plots at 4 weeks after planting (WAP), which increased at 12 WAP possibly due to slaking and collapse of soil particles by raindrops. Application of PM resulted in significantly lower B-D than the unmanured plots. There was a significant interaction effect among tillage, PM and NPK fertiliser on soil physical properties. In plots treated with combined 20 Mg ha(-1) PM (PM20) and 150 kg N ha(-1), the soil Pt of 55.6% and 57.2% obtained under CT and MT respectively at the end of the second year were significantly higher than those of the control plots (48.5% (CT) and 47.5% (MT)). In general, combined application of NPK and PM did not result in significant differences in CDR and K-s under MT and CT but the higher rate of PM (PM20) and NPK fertiliser under ZT significantly raised the CDR and reduced K-s by 20-43% in 2008 and 23-45% in 2009 relative to the unmanured plots. This implies disaggregation (higher CDR), which possibly resulted in creation of water-repellent properties causing lower K-s. Although K-s and CDR showed no significant relation with grain yield, B-D was significantly related with maize grain yield with MT tending to produce similar to 23% and 20% higher maize grain yield than ZT and CT respectively under a typical arable surface soil B-D.

A field study was conducted in runoff plots to quantify the effect of potato hilling on soil loss, soil moisture distribution and soil temperature. Three hilling practices; hilling performed at before crop emergence (pre-hilling), one-pass hilling (at 15 days after potato emergence), the conventional two-pass hilling (at 15 and 30 days after potato emergence), and the control (non-hilling) constituted the treatments. Root length density, vegetal cover, soil surface roughness and soil water infiltration capacity were quantified at different stages of potato growth and related with the sediment yield. Soil temperature and soil moisture contents were monitored using Onset HOBO sensor probes throughout the potato growth cycle. Compared to the conventional two-pass hilling, pre-hilling increased the soil moisture content by 6% and lowered the soil temperature by up to 3.4 degrees C at crop emergence, thus optimized tuber germination and growth. This ensured earlier canopy closure and reduced the cumulative sediment yield by 12 t/ha.

NN0324,"Pneumonia is the leading cause of mortality for children under five years in sub-Saharan Africa. Household air pollution has been found to increase risk of pneumonia, especially due to exposure from dirty burning biomass fuels. It has been suggested that advanced stoves, which burn fuel more efficiently and reduce smoke emissions, may help to reduce household air pollution in poor, rural settings. This qualitative study aims to provide an insight into the household costs and perceived benefits from use of the stove in Malawi. It was conducted alongside The Cooking and Pneumonia Study (CAPS), the largest village cluster-level randomised controlled trial of an advanced combustion cookstove intervention to prevent pneumonia in children under five to date. In 2015, using 100 semi-structured interviews this study assessed household time use and perceptions of the stove from both control and intervention participants taking part in the CAPS trial in Chilumba. Household direct and indirect costs associated with the intervention were calculated. Users overwhelming liked using the stove. The main reported benefits were reduced cooking times and reduced fuel consumption. In most interviews, the health benefits were not initially identified as advantages of the stove, although when prompted, respondents stated that reduced smoke emissions contributed to a reduction in respiratory symptoms. The cost of the stove was much higher than most respondents said they would be willing to pay. The stoves were not primarily seen as health products. Perceptions of limited impact on health was subsequently supported by the CAPS trial data which showed no significant effect on pneumonia. While the findings are encouraging from the perspective of acceptability, without innovative financing mechanisms, general uptake and sustained use of the stove may not be possible in this setting. The findings also raise the question of whether the stoves should be marketed and championed as 'health interventions'. (C) 2017 The Authors.

The chemical composition, intake, digestibility, nitrogen balance and rumen degradability coefficients were determined. Rumen pH and ammonia-nitrogen (NH3-N) levels were estimated in samples taken at 1, 2, 3, and 6 h after feeding. There was substitution of teff straw dry matter by the supplements. Fresh leucaena effected the highest substitution. Supplementation enhanced (p < 0.05) the dry matter degradation (DD) of teff straw at 6 and 12 hours of incubation but not (p > 0.05) for the other incubation times. There were no significant differences (p > 0.05) between treatments in the degradation constants:; readily soluble component (a) slowly degradable fraction, (b) potential degradability (PD = a + b) and rate of degradation (C) and for rumen NH3-N concentration, the ranking was CSC > sesbania > dry leucaena > fresh leucaena > teff straw alone (p < 0.05). The particularly high substitution rate observed with fresh leucaena might suggest that bulkiness may be a limiting factor in the intake of low quality roughages supplemented with tree leaves. The lower DM and OM digestibilities of the supplemented diets were attributed to substrate preference by rumen cellulolytic bacteria. Excessively high levels of rumen NH3-N (328 mg/l) in the CSC diet resulted in high urinary nitrogen losses (r(2) = 0.32; p < 0.001) leading to low N balance, This may suggest that for the utilization of poor quality tropical roughages, moderate levels of rumen NH3-N sustained over a longer period may be needed.",Ethiopia,Ethiopia,Ethiopia,TRUE,,Sheep (Meat),"teff, sesbania, leucaena, cotton seed",sheep,FALSE,major,Feed Addition-Feed Processing,feed addition,supplementation with different types of roughage supplements,Supplemental Irrigation,TRUE,,FALSE,major,Resilience,Efficiency,Efficiency,Nitrogen (Apparent Efficiency Animals Feed),"dry matter intake, digestibility, nitrogen balance, rumen NH3-N levels","dry matter intake, nitrogen balance","dry matter intake, digestibility, nitrogen balance, rumen NH3-N levels",TRUE,,FALSE,
DK0056,"Decline in farmland soil fertility due to nutrient depletion is a concern for smallholder farmers in the highlands of Ethiopia. In this study we tested if long-term addition of compost, either alone or in combination with nitrogen (N) and phosphorous (P) fertilizer, affected available soil nutrient status, grain/tuber harvests, agronomic N use efficiency, and plot level N and P nutrient balances. The on-farm experiments were conducted on four farm fields for up to 6 years in Beseku, Ethiopia. A randomized complete block design was used, with four treatments: full dose of compost applied alone at 2.4 t ha(-1) DW organic matter (C); full dose of fertilizer (F); half compost and half fertilizer (CF); and, unfertilized control. In the upper 10 cm of the surface soil, several Mehlich-3 extractable nutrients (B, Ca, K, Mg, P, S, and Zn) had significantly higher concentrations in the C treatment (P < 0.01), and some in the CF treatment (P < 0.05) than in the control. Phosphorus was the only nutrient with a higher concentration in the F treatment than the control. Maize and faba bean showed added benefits (synergy) in terms of yield increase in the CF treatment and a better agronomic efficiency for added N. Plot level N balances were negative for all treatments except C, with strong depletion in the control (-76 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1)) and F (-65 kg N ha(-1) yr(-1)) treatments. When the N balance was compared to measured change in soil N, the F and control treatments were significantly (P < 0.05) lower than zero. N in the CF and C treatments was close to steady-state, i.e., the input of N in organic matter compensated for the loss of N through mineralization. The control treatment had a negative P balance of 11 kg P ha(-1) yr(-1), with moderately negative balance of 4 kg P ha(-1) yr(-1) in the C treatment. The CF and F treatments had positive P balances. Thus, the addition of compost, both alone or in combination with mineral fertilizer, can prevent N and reduce P mining and improve the nutrient status of the soil. When only NP fertilizer was used, the crop utilized all N that was mineralized indicating that the crop was N limited. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

The study showed that under conditions of rainfall deficiency, the use of a single organic resource at an equivalent dose of 40 kg N ha(-1) better secured crop yield than the application of an equivalent amount as urea-N, while a combination of organic resources and fertiliser was better in increasing crop yield than the application of the same N amount in the form of urea. In a year of rainfall deficiency, a mix of organic resources and fertiliser in both till and no-till systems increased crop water use efficiency, with the result that the farmer was able to purchase only half of the normal quantity of N fertiliser to obtain a higher yield that he would have done when all of the N was supplied in the form of urea. Under conditions where soil N is deficient, an economic benefit was achieved when urea was combined with easily decomposable organic material (e.g. sheep dung); mixing the urea at a dose of 40 kg N ha(-1) with maize straw was not sufficient in alleviating the negative interaction due to the enhanced N immobilisation. The results demonstrate that the use of N fertiliser alone was risky and that a higher yield, with the accompanying economic benefit, was scarcely achieved under the prevailing rainfall conditions.

A study was conducted to determine the effect of composted cattle manure, mineral N fertilizer, and their combinations on NO3 concentrations in leachate leaving the root zone and to establish N fertilization rates that minimize leaching. Maize was grown for three seasons (1996-1997, 1997-1998, and 1998-1999) in field lysimeters repacked with a coarse-grained sandy soil (Typic Kandiustalf).

NN0267,"In north-eastern Uganda, the sweet potato crop of small subsistence farmers is severely affected by many pests, including (rough) sweet potato weevils, nematodes and millipedes. Field experiments with sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas (L.) Lam.) were conducted at Arapai Station in Soroti District, northeastern Uganda in three consecutive seasons to study the differences between the indigenous practice of harvesting piecemeal in combination with storage 'in-ground on plants' and one-time harvesting after crop senescence, with special reference to damage caused by sweet potato weevils (Cylas spp.), rough sweet potato weevils (Blosyrus spp.), millipedes (Diplopoda) and nematodes. The area has two rainy seasons per calendar year, the first one with long, reliable rains and the second one with short, unreliable rains. Severe sweet potato weevil damage in the vines was responsible for the mortality of 46% of the plants in Experiment I, which was carried out during the first rainy season. Starting 3 months after planting (MAP), sizable storage roots could be harvested, although their number and weight declined after 4 MAP with piecemeal harvesting. The highest storage-root yield 17.8 Mg ha(-I)) was found in Experiment 2 (second rainy season) at the final harvest. The yield of storage roots stored 'in-ground on plants' during the prolonged dry season (Experiment 3) was very low compared with the yields of Experiment I (first rainy season) and Experiment 2 (second rainy season). Sweet potato weevil damage of the storage roots was significantly less with piecemeal harvesting than with one-time harvesting, and piecemeal harvesting also increased the quality of the storage roots for human consumption and commercial purposes. However, with piecemeal harvesting the rough sweet potato weevil (Blosyrus spp.) caused more storage root damage than with one-time harvesting. No statistically significant differences between the two types of harvesting were found for damage caused by nematodes or millipedes. It was concluded that piecemeal harvesting of sweet potato storage roots contributes to the control of sweet potato weevil in both vines and storage roots and hence improves the quality of the harvested roots.

Moulds have an important place in the change in the quality of cocoa beans due to their role in the production of free fatty acids and mycotoxins, namely ochratoxin A (OTA). This study investigated the impact of the key post-harvest treatments, namely the fermentation and drying methods on OTA contamination of raw cocoa beans. Analytical methods for OTA detection were based on solid–liquid extraction, clean-up using an immunoaffinity column, and identification by reversed-phase HPLC with fluorescence detection. Of a total of 104 randomly selected cocoa samples analysed, 32% had OTA contents above 2 µg kg–1. Cocoa sourced from pods in a bad state of health had a maximum OTA content of 39.2 µg kg–1, while that obtained from healthy pods recorded 11.2 µg kg–1. The production of OTA in cocoa beans increased according to the pod-opening delay and reached 39.2 µg kg–1 after an opening delay of 7 days after harvest, while 6.1 and 11.2 µg kg–1 were observed when pods were opened after 0 and 4 days. OTA production also seemed to depend considerably to the cocoa fermentation materials. When using plastic boxes for bean fermentation, the OTA production was enhanced and reached an average OTA content of about 4.9 µg kg–1, while the raw cocoa treated in banana leaves and wooden boxes recorded 1.6 and 2.2 µg kg–1 on average respectively.

AG0041,"Background and Objective: Maize (Zea mays L.) is the primary staple food in many African countries, including Mozambique with seasonal production but continuous consumption. Post-harvest losses have been attributed to storage pests with maize weevil [Sitophilus zeamais (Motschulsky)] causing 10-20% losses while the larger grain borer [ Prostephanus truncatus (Horn)] causes losses of between 30-90%. Seed security is the key to household food security among resource poor farmers in developing countries and seed storage methods play an important role in keeping seed viability and seedling vigour over time in susceptible maize cultivars. New storage methods and technologies have been developed to reduce these post-harvest losses. This study was carried out to evaluate the efficacy of different methods on controlling losses from larger grain borer (LGB) infestation. Materials and Methods: Five different maize seed storage methods which included metal silos; Super Grain bag™ inside polypropylene bags; polypropylene bag with pre-fumigated seed with Gastoxin™ (a phosphine fumigant); polypropylene bag with Actellic Super® and polypropylene bag alone were evaluated for preservation of seed quality and control of LGB using a complete randomized design replicated four times through 6 months storage sampling within 2 months. One way ANOVA using GenStat (12th edition) statistical software were applied for analysis using 5% level of significance and four specific orthogonal contrasts were used to separate different storage methods. Results: Metal silo had the highest efficacy over the 6 months of storage, showing the lowest seed weight loss of 3.9%, the lowest seed damage of 15.6%, a high seed germination of 77% and high vigour, with a low electric conductivity of less than 3.6 µS cm -1 g-1. The Super Grain bag™ inside polypropylene bag was second in efficacy. The polypropylene bag alone was the worst, showing high seed weight loss of 28.0%, high seed damage of 88.9%, the lowest germination of <5% and worst vigour and with the highest electric conductivity of more than 6 µS cm-1 g-1. Conclusion: The metal silos demonstrated the best efficacy over other storage methods.

AG0123,"Participatory on-farm trials were conducted to assess effectiveness of Purdue Improved Crop Storage (PICS™) bags for storage of maize in small-scale farmers' stores in rural villages in eastern Kenya. A PICS bag is a three-layered hermetic bag-system that forms a barrier against the influx of oxygen and the escape of carbon dioxide. Jute, woven polypropylene or PICS bags were filled with shelled maize grain, purchased from the participating farmers, and the three sets of bags kept in the farmers' own stores for 35 weeks. Oxygen and carbon dioxide levels in the PICS bags were monitored, as well as the temperature and relative humidity in all the bags. Grain moisture, live insect population, grain damage and weight loss were examined at intervals of seven weeks. Oxygen and carbon dioxide composition demonstrated that PICS bags are capable of sustaining good air-barrier properties under farmer storage conditions. Moreover, moisture content of maize stored in PICS bags did not change throughout the storage period whereas the moisture content of maize stored in polypropylene and jute bags decreased significantly in the final 14 weeks. Maize stored in PICS bags remained free from insect infestation and the weight loss due to insect damage was below 1 %. On the contrary, polypropylene and jute bags permitted profuse build-up of insect populations. At 35 weeks, grain damage reached 77.6 % and 82.3 % corresponding to 41.2 % and 48.5 % weight loss in the polypropylene and jute bags respectively.

On-farm trials to compare alternative solutions for reducing household maize storage losses were conducted in the 2014/15 and 2015/16 storage seasons in two contrasting agro-ecological zones in the Hwedza district of Zimbabwe. A wide range of treatments including a commercial synthetic pesticide composed of fenitrothion 1% and deltamethrin 0.13%, unregistered but commonly used botanical pesticides (Aloe ash, Colophospermum mopane leaves, Eleusine coracana (rapoko) chaff, and Ocimum gratissimum), hermetic storage facilities (metal silos, GrainPro Super Grain Bags (SGB) IVR™, Purdue Improved Crop Storage (PICS) bags), and storage bags with deltamethrin incorporated into their fabric, were evaluated.

AN0041,"A large-scale study was conducted to assess which of the five most accessible hermetic storage devices on the Kenyan market fulfill the needs of smallholder farmers by positively impacting three major areas of concern: insect infestation, grain quality, and mycotoxin (aflatoxin and fumonisin) contamination. Efficacy of two hermetic silos (plastic and metal) and three hermetic bags (PICS, GrainPro's GrainSafe (TM), and Super Grain) was directly compared to current maize storage in polypropylene (PP) bags under local environmental conditions using representative storage volumes during a 6-month storage period. Impact of maize grain stored at typical (similar to 15%) and recommended (<13.5%) moisture levels and potential efficacy losses through frequent interruption of the underlying hermetic principals was assessed. Hermetic storage significantly reduced the increase in aflatoxin compared to PP bags regardless of the moisture level of the grain. An <5% per month aflatoxin increase was achieved by three of the five devices tested: Metal silo, PICS and GrainSafe (TM) bag. A strong correlation between grain moisture, storage time and aflatoxin development was found in PP bags, but not in any of the hermetic devices. The same result was not obtained for fumonisin development in stored maize. The rate of Fumonisin increase was similar in all tested devices, including the polypropylene bags, and conditions. The periodic opening of the hermetic devices had no significant effect on the efficacy of the hermetic devices but the repeated disturbance of the PP bags led to a significant increase in aflatoxin levels. The maize weevil Sitophilus spp. was most commonly found with a total incidence of 72%. Grain storage under hermetic conditions reduced insect infestation, grain weight loss and discoloration. However, maize storage above recommended moisture levels led to a distinct odor development in all hermetic devices but not the PP bags.

DK0132,"Mango, Mangifera indica L. (Anacardiaceae), is one of the most important fruits in Africa, providing household nutrition and economic development opportunities for millions of growers across the continent. In Kenya, over 80% of mango production is carried out by smallholders who produce this crop for both the domestic and the export markets. Despite its importance, mango production is hampered by several constraints, including infestation by fruit flies, especially the exotic Bactrocera dorsalis. In addition to its direct damage to fruits, the high quarantine status of the pest restricts the export of fruits and limits access to lucrative markets, impacting negatively on export earnings. To facilitate access to export markets, post-harvest management measures such as hot-water treatment are required to ensure quarantine security. Internationally, this level has been set as either 99.99% (Probit 8.7) or 99.9968% (Probit 9). In developing a protocol, the development of immature life stages of B. dorsalis in 'Apple' mango was established. Using this information, infested mangoes harbouring the different immature life stages were subjected to a hot-water treatment of 46.1°C for four different times, and the egg mortality and larval mortality were determined. The third-instar life stage was the most heat tolerant, followed by second- and first-instar larvae and the egg stage, respectively. The immersion time of 81.47 min (95% CL 75.77–87.18) was established as the time required to achieve 99.99% security level.

Two modes of insect infestation were used whereby 50 adult insects were introduced inside and outside the hermetic bags to simulate resident and incoming insect infestations, respectively. Parameters measured included carbon dioxide-oxygen levels, live adult P. truncatus numbers, grain moisture content, grain damage and weight loss, germination, and number of insect-induced perforations on plastic liners. Externally infested bags had no insect activity; all the introduced insects died of starvation. Internally infested bags were all perforated. The ordinary plastic liner was severely perforated with 151 insect-induced holes compared to hermetic plastic liners (<40 holes). There was no live adult insect infestation in grain samples collected using double-tube multi-slotted sampling probes inserted vertically several times. However, live adult insects were present in the bottom grain layer (0.05 m) of all plastic liners. There were no significant differences between hermetic bags regardless of mode of infestation for all parameters assessed. The results show that the tested hermetic bags are equally susceptible to perforations by resident P. truncatus. © The Author(s) 2018.

DK0099,"Many smallholder farmers in sub-Saharan Africa rely on synthetic pesticides for protecting stored-grain. Recommendations on use of these grain protectants are typically based on 'blanket' application rates which are fixed rates that are not varied according to grain type, pest range or agro-climatic regions. There are numerous anecdotal reports of storage pesticide failure or reduced efficacy from farmers. Might rising global temperatures be a contributory factor? Smallholder farmers are responding by over-applying pesticides, increasing the application frequency or switching to non-recommended pesticides; leading to a pesticide treadmill. Trials to determine the efficacy and persistence of five commercially-available synthetic pesticides applied at manufacturer's recommended rates on stored sorghum grain under contrasting climatic conditions were conducted in Mbire (mean temperatures of 32–42 °C and 30–50% rh) and Harare (18–32 °C; 42–75% rh) districts in Zimbabwe. Grain samples were collected at 8-week intervals throughout a 10 month period in the 2014/15 and 2015/16 storage seasons. The samples were analyzed for insect grain damage, weight loss, total number of storage insects by species and grain moisture content. Results showed significant differences in the performance of treatments (p < 0.001). Grain damage was consistently higher in Harare than in Mbire. Tribolium castaneum was the dominant pest in Mbire, while Sitotroga cerealella and Sitophilus oryzae were dominant in Harare. Tribolium castaneum populations were high in the Shumba Super dust® (fenitrothion 1% + deltamethrin 0.13%) treatment in Mbire, while S. cerealella was dominant in Super guard® (pirimiphos-methyl 1.6% + permethrin 0.4%) and Actellic Gold dust® (pirimiphos-methyl 1.6% + thiamethoxam 0.36%) treated grain in Harare. Grain moisture content varied with ambient conditions, and was high in treatments with high insect pest levels. The results show that differences in climatic conditions influence insect pest species dynamics and response to pesticide treatments. Storage pesticides are not equally effective across different climatic conditions; thus more context-specific application recommendations are required. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Zimbabwe,Zimbabwe,Zimbabwe,TRUE,,Sorghum,sorghum,sorghum,TRUE,,Storage,Storage,synthetic pesticides application,Inorganic Fertilizers,FALSE,major,FALSE,major,Resilience,Physical,Pest & Pathogen,"Pest & Pathogen (Numbers), Pest & Pathogen (Losses)","insect grain damage, weight loss, total number of storage insects by species, grain moisture content","grain damage, weight loss, grain moisture","Pest & Pathogen (Numbers), Pest & Pathogen (Losses)",TRUE,,FALSE,minor
JS0004,"In West Africa, the most damaging lepidopteran pest of maize ears is the pyralid Mussidia nigrivenella. Although it is mostly described as a field pest, it can be found feeding on maize stored for up to 4 months. A survey was conducted in Benin in 2006 to assess M. nigrivenella infestations in different maize storage systems in the Southern (SGS) and Northern Guinea Savanna (NGS). In SGS and NGS the percentage of infested stores decreased from 86.7% to 26.7% and from 51.4% to 14.3%, respectively, during the first 28 weeks of storage. During the same time, mean numbers of M. nigrivenella per cob decreased from 0.36 to 0.04 across both zones. All larval stages, but mostly 3rd-5th instars, were frequently found even after more than 12 weeks, indicating that M. nigrivenella may have reproduced in storage, although reinfestation or delayed development could also explain this observation. The highest M. nigrivenella incidences of 16.8% and 14.4% were found in the ""Ava"" and crib stores, respectively. Infestations were highest in ""Ava"" and lowest in maize grain stored in polyethylene bags or in mud silos. In a laboratory experiment, the presence of post-harvest beetles negatively affected the bionomics of M. nigrivenella, indicating strong interspecific competition. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

JS0089,"The powdered leaves of Cassia sophera along with hot- and cold-water leaf extracts of this plant were tested in laboratory experiments in the UK and in field trials in Tamale, Northern Ghana, using traditional storage containers. to determine their inhibitory and toxic effects against Sitophilits oryzae and Callosobruchus maculatus infestation of stored rice and cowpea, respectively. Laboratory and field experiments with cowpea showed that the use of C sophera hot-water extracts was more effective at reducing C maculatus infestation and adult emergence on cowpea than the traditional leaf-powder application (1% and 5% w/w) or the use of a cold-water extract of C sophera. Hot-water extracts of C sophera might be a more effective technique of applying the plant material on to stored coxvpea than using powdered C sophera leaves, the currently used application by small-scale farmers. In contrast, experiments with S. oryzae on rice showed that C sophera leaf powder (5% w/w) effectively reduced adult emergence in the laboratory, but this could not be confirmed under field conditions. The hot and dry climatic conditions in the field might impart a natural protection against rice infestation by S. oryzae, making the use of protectants and pesticides less necessary for farmers. This was supported by the negligible rice grain damage after 6 months of field storage and by the failure of the S. oryzae population to establish itself under field conditions. The implications of using botailicals in pest control are discussed. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

LM0286,"To protect their maize from pests such as the larger grain borer (Prostephanus truncatus), and from theft, farmers in Africa are abandoning traditional storage structures:; they shell their maize earlier and tend to store the grain inside the house in polypropylene bags. However, losses due to insects during storage remain high. Hermetic storage containers, such as metal silos (soldered airtight) and super grain bags (made from high-density polyethylene to reduce gas exchange), may enable farmers to reduce post-harvest losses. To test the different containers' effectiveness to control insect pests, on-station trials were conducted at three sites in Kenya under artificial infestation with maize weevils (Sitophilus zeamais) and larger grain borers (P. truncatus). The experiment consisted of six treatments, using three different types of containers and two different insecticides:; i) polypropylene bags without insecticides; ii) polypropylene bags with Actellic Super; iii) super grain bags without insecticide; iv) metal silos without insecticide; v) metal silos with Actellic Super; and vi) metal silos with Phostoxin. Treatments were replicated three times per site. The results demonstrated that metal silos are very effective in controlling maize weevils and the larger grain borer. The use of both Actellic Super and Phostoxin in the metal silos did not lead to a significant increase in insect mortality or reduction in grain weight loss. Super grain bags controlled insect pests well, but insect mortality was not complete and all bags in the trial were perforated, almost certainly by P. truncatus. We conclude that it is technically feasible to control storage insects without insecticides in Africa by using hermetic storage, either metal silos or super bags. The super bags, however, might not be suitable in areas with a high incidence of P. truncatus. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

NJ0001,"Seven methods for storing maize were tested and compared with traditional storage of maize in polypropylene bags. Twenty farmers managed the experiment under their prevailing conditions for 30 weeks. Stored grain was assessed for damage every six weeks. The dominant storage insect pests identified were the Maize weevil (Sitophilus zeamais) and the Red flour beetle (Tribolium castaneum). The moisture content of grain in hermetic conditions increased from 12.5 +/- 0.2% at the start of storage to a range of 13.0 +/- 0.2-13.5 +/- 0.2% at 30 weeks. There was no significant difference (F = 87.09; P < 0.0001) regarding insect control and grain damage between hermetic storage and fumigation with insecticides. However, the insecticide treatment of polypropylene yarn (ZeroFly (R)) did not control the insect populations for the experimental period under farmers' management. Grain damage was significantly lower in hermetic storage and fumigated grain than ZeroFly (R) and polypropylene bags without fumigation. No significant difference in grain damage was found between airtight treatment alone and when combined with the use of insecticides. During storage, S. zeamais was predominant and could be of more economic importance than T castaneum as far as maize damage is concerned. At 30 weeks, the germination rate of grain stored with insecticides or in hermetic storage (68.5 +/- 3.6% to 81.4 +/- 4.0%) had not significantly reduced from the rate before storage (F = 15.55; P < 0.0001) except in ZeroFly (R), also in polypropylene bags without treatment. Even though such bags did not control storage pests, farmers still liked this cheap technology. Hermetic storage techniques can be recommended to farmers without the use of insecticides provided they are inexpensive, and the proper application of technologies is ensured. (C) 2018 The Authors.

NJ0009,"Rice is the world'smost important staple food and the basis of the diet of the majority of the population. In small farm agriculture, the yields obtained in cereal production are usually low and losses, both in the field and during storage, are dramatically high, particularly in developing countries. In Mozambique, these aspects, together with an increased frequency of floods, are hindering advances in rice production. Aimed at contributing to the reduction of losses in stored rice, trials were carried out to compare the effectiveness of traditional raffia bags and of hermetic storage using single and double plastic bags concerning quantitative losses and seed quality, including germination potential, after three and six months of storage. Pest identification, insect populations estimates, percentage of weight loss, germination power and seedling vigor were evaluated. The results showed that, in descending order of density, Angoumois grain moth (. Sitotroga cerealella Olivier),lesser grain borer (. Rhyzopertha dominica F.), rice/maize weevil (. Sitophilus zeamais Mostch. and Sitophilus oryzae L.) and red flour beetle [. Tribolium castaneum (Herbst)] were the main insects infesting the rice. When compared to hermetic storage with both single and duplicate airtight bags, traditional storage presented statistically significant higher mean infestation density (30.63-53.94 individuals/kg in traditional and 0.71-3.50 individuals/kg in hermetic storage) and percentage of weight loss (3.03-3.44% in traditional contrasting with 0.27-0.47% in hermetic conditions). In traditional storage a significant 38.25% drop in the germination potential was also observed, attaining values below the established minimum tolerated in Mozambique (80%), while under hermetic storage, that reduction remained within the acceptable values of 13.9-17.5%. The distinct storage methods did not produce significant differences on the moisture content of the grain. These results demonstrate that the use of hermetic storage has resulted in a safe, pesticide-free, and sustainable storage method, suitable for rice seeds, with advantages over traditional bagging. The results presented here lead to propose hermetic storage to be adopted by paddy small farmers, in order to lever food security and income generation in the country. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",Mozambique,Mozambique,Mozambique,TRUE,,Rice,rice,rice,TRUE,,Storage,Storage,"hermetic storage, traditional storage, double plastic bags, single plastic bags","hermetic storage, traditional storage",TRUE,,FALSE,minor,Resilience,Physical,Pest & Pathogen,"Pest & Pathogen (Numbers), Pest & Pathogen (Losses)","infestation density, percentage weight loss, germination potential, seedling vigor","Pest & Pathogen (Numbers), weight loss","Pest & Pathogen (Numbers), Pest & Pathogen (Losses)",TRUE,,TRUE,

NJ0019,"Maize is a key food crop in West Africa, where Benin, Ghana, Burkina Faso and Nigeria account for most of the regional production. Storage pests are major constraints in the maize value chain, with losses reaching 30%. Simple, low-cost triple bagging technology (now known as PICS - Purdue Improved Crop Storage) originally developed for postharvest storage of cowpea was evaluated for applicability to maize storage. Thirteen test units employing PICS bag were set up in July and August 2012 at eleven localities in Benin, Burkina Faso and Ghana. Each trial unit consisted of 3 or 4 PICS bags of 50 kg capacity and 2 woven control bags. We used locally purchased naturally infested maize that had relatively high levels of infestation with Prostephanus truncatus Horn, Sitophilus zeamais Motschulsky, 1855 and/or Rhyzopertha dominica (F.) (seven localities) or lightly infested maize showing little or no evidence of damage (four localities). After 6.5 months of storage in PICS bags, there was 95-100% insect mortality at all sites. The percentage of damaged seeds and the 100 seeds weights in PICS bags were unchanged from what was recorded at the time the experiment was set up. Seed viability was well maintained; germination rates of seeds from the PICS bags did not differ from that observed at the beginning of the experiment. Aflatoxin tests were carried out on 245 samples, with 53% having levels above 20 ppm in both PICS and woven bags. Samples from PICS bags tended to be less contaminated than those from woven bags. PICS bags can be used for maize storage even in areas with high prevalence of P. truncatus, but storage of maize should begin soon after harvest and drying to minimize bag damage that can occur when very high numbers of P. truncatus are present.

However, in some African countries knowledge gaps exist on the effectiveness of hermetic maize storage, particularly where the Larger Grain Borer (LGB), Prostephanus truncatus occurs. Trials simulating African smallholder farmer conditions were conducted at two sites in contrasting agro-ecological zones in Zimbabwe for up to 12 months during the 2013/14 storage season. There were two hermetic treatments: metal silos and hermetic bags; and two non-hermetic treatments: a registered synthetic pesticide and untreated control, in polypropylene bags. Two modes of infestation: natural and combined (natural plus artificial) were used as factors. Treatments were arranged in a completely randomised design and stored in ordinary rooms. Hermetic treatments were significantly superior (P < 0.001) to non-hermetic treatments in preserving germination, controlling insect population development, suppressing maize grain damage, controlling grain dust production and consequently limiting weight loss during storage. Hermetic bags were more effective than non-hermetic treatments in reducing storage losses despite the plastic liners having multiple insect-induced perforations of more than 300 holes per plastic liner at termination. However, there were no significant differences between metal silos and hermetic bags regardless of the mode of infestation. There was strong correlation between total insect population per kg and: percentage grain damage, percentage weight loss, and grain dust which indicate the importance of controlling insect pest development during storage to reduce losses.

The effects of the common soil management practices (bare soil, conservation tillage, mulching, and compaction) on soil erodibility were studied under a simulated rainfall. The universal soil loss equation (USLE) nomogram-based Kfactors for each plot were also estimated. The Soil erodibility values varied from 0.014 in mulched soils to 0.022 measured for the bare soils. The erodibility values measured from bare soil were above the nomogram-based values. Mulching and compaction demonstrated high potentials of controlling soil erosion, but due soil densification, compaction resulted into largest runoff volume, and could effect crop growth by wearing away of nutrients. The effectiveness of conservation tillage was found to rely on extent of ground cover. Mulching is thus the most recommended means of soil erosion control in the area. © 2006-2014 Asian Research Publishing Network (ARPN).",Nigeria,Nigeria,NA,TRUE,,Cowpea-Maize,NA,NA,TRUE,,"Crop Residue Incorporation-Mulch, Crop Residue-Reduced Tillage","reduced tillage, mulch","bare soil, conservation tillage, mulching, compaction","Reduced Tillage, Mulch",TRUE,,TRUE,,Resilience,Physical,Soil Quality,Runoff,"soil erodibility, runoff volume",runoff,runoff,TRUE,,TRUE,
LM0144,"The purpose of the study was to quantify and predict the rainfall-runoff relationships in the technique of in-field rain water harvesting (IRWH) during maize growing season on Bainsvlei Kenilworth ecotope. The plot set-up was performed according to different runoff strip lengths (RSL) and mulching level (ML) treatments. The growing season received more rainfall events of low amount and high percentage of rain events of short duration (<60 mm) and low intensity (<= 10 mm h(-1)) compared to long-term. This reveals that the considerations of only relatively large and intense rain events for in-field runoff (Ro) estimation would failed to provide reliable runoff estimation under IRWH system. The mean runoff comparison from runoff strip length shows that the narrow (RSL-1) plots generate significant more runoff than the wide (RSL-3) plots with mean Ro from the RSL-1 being nearly 3 times more than that from RSL-3 plots that is due to lower water storage capacity and surface friction in the narrow runoff strips. The bare management harvested more in-field runoff water and showed a significant difference from 39% and 96% mulch level cover. From a linear regression analysis, runoff was significantly affected by amount of rainfall, mulch level, runoff strip lengths and peak rainfall intensities with R-2 of 0.69. The model shows that the main characteristics of the rainfall event (amount and peak intensity) are positively related to runoff, whereas an increase in runoff length and addition of mulch cover both reduce in-field runoff water. The performance of the model yielded good results (D = 0.97) provides relatively satisfactory results with MAE value of 0.71 mm over the growing period. By analyzing, probability curves for in-field runoff processes during the growing season, simulated long-term Ro showed the amount of in-field runoff collectable water from a bare narrow plot (RSL-1) has more advantage for infiltration in the basins, while wide strips (RSL-3) with full mulch cover (96%) infiltrate more the rainwater on the runoff strips. The overall results obtained explain that the physical property of the fine sandy loam soil with gentle slope (<1%) of this experimental site enhances infiltration due to soft crust formation in the top soil surface. This implies that the soil has an ability to hold considerable amount of water following a wet period or after a rain event which was then accessed by the roots during short dry spells.

NN0239,"Droughts, resulting in low crop yields, are common in the semi-arid areas of Ethiopia and adversely influence the wellbeing of many people. The introduction of any strategy that could increase yields would therefore be advantageous. The objective of this study was to attempt to assess the influence of in-field rainwater harvesting (IRWH), compared to conventional tillage, on increasing the amount of water available to a crop like maize on a semi-arid ecotope at Melkassa situated in the eastern part of the Rift Valley. To achieve the objective of the study rainfall-runoff measurements were made during 2003 and 2004 oil 2 in x 2 in plots provided with a runoff measuring system and replicated 3 times for each treatment. There were 2 treatments:; conventional tillage (CT) on which hand cultivation was practised in a way that simulated the normal local CT; and a flat surface simulating the no-till, undisturbed surface of the IRWH technique (NT). Rainfall-runoff measurements were made over 2 rainy seasons during which there were 25 storms with > 9 min of rain. From the 25 storms, only the 2(nd) season storms (8 storms) had runoff measurements. These storms were used for calibration and validation of the Morin and Cluff (1980) runoff model (MC Model). Appropriate values for final infiltration rate (I(f)), surface storage (s) and for the crusting parameter (gamma) were found to be:; 6 mm.h(-1); 1.0 mm for NT and 6.0 mm for CT; 0.6 mm(-1), respectively. The measured runoff (R) for the 2004 rainy season expressed as a fraction of the rainfall during the measuring period (P), i.e. R/P, gave values of 0.59 and 0.40 for the NT and CT treatments, respectively. There was a statistical difference between the runoff oil the 2 treatments. Selected results from 7 years of field experiments with IRWH at Glen in South Africa were used together with measured maize yields and climate data over 16 seasons on the nearby Melkassa Experiment Station to estimate the yield benefits of IRWH compared to CT on the ecotope studied. The results ranged between 35 and 1 437 kg with a mean of 711 kg.ha(-1) over the 16 years. At Melkassa this was an estimated yield increase ranging from 13% to 49%.

DK0044,"Field water conservation practices are a way to build resilience against drought by increasing productive green water through reducing runoff and evaporation and thereby boosting crop yield. A field study was undertaken on permanently kept rainfed experimental plots established in 2005 on a vertisol in order to evaluate two resource saving cropping systems based on conservation agriculture (CA) that integrate in situ soil and water conservation tillage practices (derdero+ and terwah+) as compared to a conventional system in terms of soil moisture, runoff, water loss (drainage and evapotranspiration together), water productivity and crop yield. The experimental layout was a randomized complete block design with three replications and a plot size of 5mx19m. The farming systems differed in tillage practice, but all had wheat, teff, barley and grass pea crops grown in rotation. The tillage treatments were (i) derdero+ (DER+) with a furrow and permanent raised bed planting system, plowed only by refreshing the furrow once at planting with no tillage on top of the permanently kept raised beds, 30% standing crop straw retention, and with ~20% of the crop residue being covered with soil during refreshing the furrow at planting, (ii) terwah+ (TER+) with furrows made at 1.5m intervals, plowed once at planting, 30% standing crop straw retention and fresh broad beds, and crop residue being partly covered with soil during tillage at planting, and (iii) conventional tillage (CT) with a minimum of three plain tillage operations and complete removal of crop straw. All plowing as well as the maintenance of the furrows of the permanent raised beds was done using a local ard plow called mahresha. Glyphosate was sprayed at 2lha-1 to control weeds before crop emergence, starting from 2007 with DER+ and TER+. Runoff was collected at the lower end of each plot in calibrated runoff collectors after each runoff event. Soil-water content was measured using the gravimetric method at 5-6 day intervals. Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) was measured in the field at several phenological stages, using a handheld GreenSeeker™ Optical Sensor Unit. Soil-water storage (0-80cm soil depth) during the growing season was always highest with DER+ followed by TER+ and CT, whereas the opposite trend was observed for runoff. On the other hand, deep drainage and evapotranspiration was always highest in the DER+ compared to CT. NDVI records throughout the growing season were significantly highest with DER+ for wheat and grass pea, while the highest values were observed with TER+ when under teff. These values were directly proportional to the above ground crop biomass and yield. The grain and straw yield of wheat in 2009 was increased from 1.6 and 3.7tha-1 with CT to 2.6 and 5.2tha-1 with DER+, respectively.

We recorded daily rainfall and runoff depth from 18 runoff plots (30m longx6m wide) representing the five main land-use types with various SWC practices and two slope classes (gentle and steep). CN values were derived using the lognormal geometric mean CN procedure. Runoff was significantly less from plots with SWC measures, with average reductions of 44 and 65% observed in cultivated and non-agricultural lands, respectively.

LM0259,"Nutrient loss from water erosion is a major contributor to negative nutrient balance in most sub-Saharan African countries. Due to their low-cost, narrow grass strips are becoming popular as means of controlling soil erosion. There is a need to study the effectiveness of narrow grass strips in controlling nutrient loss due to water erosion. Performance of narrow strips of Vetiver (Vetiveria zizanioides) and Napier (Pennisetum purpureum) grass in controlling nutrient loss and runoff was determined on a clay loam soil in Kenya. Grass strips were planted in March 2000, and nutrient loss and runoff measurements were carried out from June 2000 to August 2001 (15 months). Compared with the control, Napier grass reduced PO4-P, NO2-N, NO3-N and NH4-N by 55, 70, 45 and 47%, respectively, while Vetiver grass reduced them by 11, 35, 11 and 0%, respectively. Napier grass and Vetiver grass reduced runoff by an average of 54 and 12%, respectively. Napier grass was more effective, since it formed a barrier faster than Vetiver grass.

LM0313,"Rainwater conservation on watershed basis is key to controlling land degradation and ensuring sustainable high yields in Eritrea, which has only 17.2% land potentially available for agriculture. Study was undertaken in 4.29 ha watershed (slope <1-33%) at Hamelmalo with a mission to store entire rainwater as soil water through adoption of soil conservation measures. Measurements were made of slope, runoff, soil loss, gullies and basic soil properties. Based on slope, watershed land was divided into block A (1.32 ha; slope <= 1%), block B (0.89 ha; slope >12-33%) and block C (2.08 ha; slope >1-12%). Runoff was measured for 2 years from 30 m(2) plots on 3, 6 and 9% slopes using a 10 slot runoff divisor placed at the outlet. Soil loss was determined by drying part of the storm runoff. About 80-90% of the rainfall exceeding 20 mm was being lost as runoff from 9% slope. Weighted average runoff from the watershed was 66% of the rainfall, which reduced to zero after development. Soil loss was 42.4 t ha(-1) year(-1) on 3% slope and 268.6 t ha(-1) year(-1) on 9% slope. Soil was stony loamy sand in block A, gravelly loamy sand in block B and gravelly sandy loam in block C. Bunding was done in block A (<= 1% slope), ridging in block B (>12-33% slope) and broad base conservation bench terracing in block C (>1-12% slope). Runoff storage canal was constructed along foot of the block B land to intercept runoff. Soil bunds, terraces with shoulder bunds and runoff storage canals were most effective in rainwater conservation. Ridges in block B were unstable. After development, land in block A upgraded to capability class III, block B to class V and block C to class I, subject to availability of irrigations. Maximum water holding capacity of soils was 0.378 m(3) m(-3) in block A, 0.389 m(3) m(-3) in block B and 0.45 m(3) m(-3) in block C. Soil profile in 2 m depth could thus accommodate about 756 mm rainwater in block A, 778 mm in block B and 900 mm in block C. This is more than peak rainfall in the last 90 years. Watershed development prevented further land degradation and raised average yield of sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L.) from <600 kg ha(-1) on farmer's fields to 1930 kg ha(-1) in block A and 3818 kg ha(-1) in block C.

NJ0076,"In this study, we quantified surface runoff and soil loss along a toposequence considering four land use systems and three topographic segment positions in Rwizi catchment, Lake Victoria Basin (LVB). The land use systems were grassland dominated by a local species known as ""Omugugu"" (Cyperus spp.), tree plantation of pine (Pinus sabiniana) and eucalyptus (Eucalyptus globus), mulched banana (Musa Paradisiaca), and unmulched banana, topographically located on the foot slope, midslope, and summit. Runoff and soil loss magnitude and trends under varied rainfall regimes were measured using dosed runoff plots measuring 2 x 20 m (40 m(2)). A 'split plot experimental design was adopted for the study. In total, 36 runoff plots were installed considering the land use and topographic factors with three replications. Observed monthly rainfall values varied from 9.3 to 167 mm (75 54 mm). Annually, the registered rainfall depth was 680 mm. The annual rainfall depth was below the long-term annual mean for the area. Nearly all rainfall events with a depth greater than 10 mm contributed relatively heavy runoff; while rainfall events less than 10 mm in general caused minor surface runoff at the sites. Annual runoff within,the catchment at the studied sites varied from 42 to 411 m(3) ha(-1) y(-1). The average observed cross-site annual runoff was 151 +/- 95 m(3) ha(-1) y(-1).

However, the effectiveness of SWC measures on runoff dynamics and sediment load in terms of their medium- and short-term effects has not been sufficiently studied. A study was conducted in 2011 to 2015 in the Gumara-Maksegnit watershed to study the impacts of SWC structures on runoff and soil erosion processes using the soil and water analysis tool (SWAT) model. The study was conducted in two adjacent watersheds where in one of the watersheds, SWC structures were constructed (treated watershed (TW)) in 2011, while the other watershed was a reference watershed without SWC structures (untreated watershed (UW)). For both watersheds, separate SWAT and SWAT-CUP (SWAT calibration and uncertainty procedure) projects were set up for daily runoff and sediment yield. The SWAT-CUP program was applied to optimize the parameters of the SWAT using daily observed runoff and sediment yield data. The runoff simulations indicated that SWAT can reproduce the hydrological regime for both watersheds.

HK0185,"A study was carried out on a previously eroded Oxic Paleustalf in Ibadan, southwestern Nigeria to determine the extent of soil degradation under mound tillage with some herbaceous legumes and residue management methods. A series of factorial experiments was carried out on 12 existing runoff plots. The study commenced in 1996 after a 5-year natural fallow. Mound tillage was introduced in 1997 till 1999. The legumes - Vigna unguiculata (cowpea), Mucuna pruriens and Pueraria phaseoloides - were intercropped with maize in 1996 and 1998 while yam was planted alone in 1997 and 1999. This paper covers 1997-1999. At the end of each year, residues were either burned or mulched on respective plots. Soil loss, runoff, variations in mound height, bulk density, soil water retention and sorptivity were measured. Cumulative runoff was similar among interactions of legume and residue management in 1997 (57-151 mm) and 1999 (206-397 mm). However, in 1998, cumulative runoff of 95 mm observed for Mucuna-burned residue was significantly greater than the 46 mm observed for cowpea-burned residue and the 39-51 mm observed for mulched residues of cowpea, Mucuna and Pueraria. Cumulative soil loss of 7.6 Mg ha(-1) observed for Mucuna-burned residue in 1997 was significantly greater than those for Pueraria-mulched (0.9 Mg ha(-1)) and Mucuna-mulched (1.4 Mg ha(-1)) residues whereas in 1999 it was similar to soil loss from cowpea treatments and Pueraria-burned residue (2.3-5.3 Mg ha(-1)). There were no significant differences in soil loss in 1998 (1-3.2 Mg ha(-1)) whereas Mucuna-burned residue had a greater soil loss (28.6 Mg ha(-1)) than mulched cowpea (6.9 Mg ha(-1)) and Pueraria (5.4 Ms ha(-1)). Mound heights (23 cm average) decreased non-linearly with cumulative rainfall. A cumulative rainfall of 500 mm removed 0.3-2.3 cm of soil from mounds in 1997, 3.5-6.9 cm in 1998 and 2.3-4.6 cm in 1999, indicating that (detached but less transported) soil from mounds was far higher than observed soil loss in each year. Soil water retention was improved at potentials ranging from -1 to -1500 kPa by Mucuna-mulched residue compared to the various burned-residue treatments. Also, mound sorptivity at -1 cm water head (14.3 cm h(-1/2)) was higher than furrow sorptivity (8.5 cm h(-1/2)), indicating differences in hydraulic characteristics between mound and furrow. Pueraria-mulched residues for mounds had the highest sorptivity of 17.24 cm h(-1/2), whereas the least value of 6.96 cm h(-1/2) was observed in furrow of Mucuna-burned residue.

LM0292,"Collective action, on communal grazing land, has evolved in the highlands of northwestern Ethiopia to mitigate the problems of feed shortage and land degradation due to overgrazing. The exercise is liked by farmers for improving the availability of natural pasture during the long dry season when other feed sources get depleted. However, large portions of the communal grazing lands are still managed under free grazing throughout the year. This study was undertaken in Maynet village in the upper Blue Nile basin, northwestern Ethiopia, to assess the impacts of three different types of grazing land management (GLM) and two slope gradients (<10%; 15-25%) on aboveground herbaceous biomass yield, ground cover, species richness, runoff, soil loss and soil bulk density of grazing lands. The GLMs include (a) freely open communal GLM, (b) restricted communal GLM - collective management of communal grazing land locally named as 'yebere sar' and (c) private holding GLM. Stocking density was more than carrying capacity of grazing lands across all GLMs. However, the extent of overstocking problem was exceptionally severe in freely open communal GLM. The interaction between GLM and slope was significant (P<0.05) for runoff, soil loss and runoff coefficient. The average runoff coefficient was close to 50% in freely open communal GLM on steeper slopes (15-25%). Freely open communal GLM on steeper slopes resulted in consistently highest cumulative runoff and soil loss amounting to 491mm and 32t/ha per year, respectively. Polynomial regression analysis showed that quadratic relationship (r2=0.87) existed between soil loss and runoff. But, soil loss was close to nil when runoff did not exceed 2mm per rainfall event. As expected, restricted communal GLM appeared to reduce surface runoff by more than 40% and curb the rate of soil erosion by more than 50% compared to freely open communal GLM. Its vegetation cover persisted above 70% throughout the year, meeting the threshold level recommended to keep surface runoff and soil loss to minimum.

JS0274.1,"Vertisols are among the most common, high-potential soils in the central highlands of Ethiopia, where over 88% of human and 77% of the livestock population are located. Productivity from these soils is constrained by severe waterlogging due to their physical properties and intensive rainfall in summer. Traditionally, farmers plant late in the season to avoid the waterlogging, which results in harvest yields that are far below optimal. To bridge this yield gap, the broad-bed and furrow system for surface drainage has been introduced. Despite reported yields of various crops, little is known of the on-site and off-site impacts of this system. Consequently, four land preparation methods viz. (i) broad-bed and furrow (BBF), (ii) green manure (GM), (iii) the traditional system of ridge and furrow (RF) and (iv) reduced tillage (RT) were compared on standard runoff plots for 5 years (1998-2002) at Caffee Doonsaa in the central Highlands of Ethiopia. Runoff, sediment, organic carbon and nutrient (organic nitrogen and available phosphorus) losses were determined during the last two years (2001 and 2002). Over 50% of the seasonal rainfall was lost as runoff, regardless of the treatment, with significantly more of the excess water running off BBF and RT treatments in both years. The BBF system drained 67% and 54% of rainfall as runoff in 2001 and 2002, respectively, compared with 61% and 53% from the RT system during the measurement period. Although not statistically significant, the largest sediment and total nutrient losses tended to be from the BBF. The effect of the treatments on total nutrient loss and enrichment ratio was inconsistent. The nutrient concentration in the eroded sediment was greater than that of the originating surface soil but was strongly correlated. The effect of the land preparation methods was significant and varied with crops.

LM0213,"This paper forms part of an investigation of the water use by a hillslope agroforestry system incorporating Grevillea robusta, a fast-growing tree species, and maize. Soil moisture deficits were monitored using a network of neutron probe access tubes monitored weekly over 5 years, in plots containing either trees or crops grown separately, as well as grown together as an agroforestry system. The agroforestry system had the highest water use, the trees grown alone used slightly less water and a conventional maize crop used significantly less water than either of the treatments incorporating trees, leading to substantial losses of water from the system through deep drainage. Significant differences in surface soil water input to and uptake from the soil profile were observed over the relatively small distances between trees. After rainfall, the soil water content close to the trees (0.3 m) increased more than it did at a 2.5 m distance. This was attributed to stemflow, and it was assumed that increased soil water uptake at the same position was due to higher root activity close to the trees. The importance of stemflow to the further development and refinement of existing process-based agroforestry models is discussed. It was demonstrated that moderate pruning of the tree canopy, although reducing competition for light between the trees and crops (data not shown), did Little to limit the water demand of the tree component, resulting in little or no recharge to the soil profile. When the tree canopy was more heavily pruned, following the example of local farm management practices, the water requirement of the tree component was reduced and the soil profile water storage was able to recharge following rainfall. The rationale for including substantial tree pruning as a part of agroforestry site management practices is discussed. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

Data on soil water content were collected from 6 days before and 20, 60 and 110 days after sorghum transplanting. The main findings were:; (i) Per unit root length, A. nilotica had a more negative effect on sorghum above and below ground than P. juliflora.

On hillsides, planting improved tree fallows on the degraded upper section of bench terraces is a recommended practice to improve soil fertility while cropping continues on the lower terrace to maintain food production. This study examined the influence of tree fallows on soil water content (theta (w) ) and evaporation (E (s) ). Alnus acuminata Kunth (alnus), Calliandra calothyrsus Meissner (calliandra), Sesbania sesban L.

Neutron probe and microlysimeter approaches were used to determine theta (w) and E (s) when the trees were c. 3.5 years old. Sesbania and alnus increased theta (w) by 9-18 % in the cropping area on the lower terrace but calliandra reduced theta (w) by 3-15 %. After heavy rain, E (s) comprised 29-38 % of precipitation in the tree-based treatments and 53 % under sole crops. Absolute values declined as rainfall decreased, but E (s) as a proportion of rainfall increased to 39-45 % in the tree-based treatments and 62 % for sole crops. Root + shoot pruning of alnus and the tree mixture increased theta (w) in the cropping area but had no significant effect in the other tree-based treatments.

NJ0155,"Biochar (BC) has been reported to improve a number of soil structural and hydraulic properties but detailed studies are scant on how BC affects crust formation, penetration resistance, water repellency and saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ksat). The objective of this study was to quantify the effect of maize cob BC of three different particle sizes on soil crusting (penetration resistance), water repellency, and Ksat of loamy fine sand and sandy loam in Zambia. The BC particle sizes were <0.5 and 1–5 mm applied at 17.5 and 35 t ha-1 in the two soils and intermediate size of 0.5–1 mm applied at lower rates (17.5 and 28 t ha-1 in the loamy fine sand and 13.3 and 26.7 t ha-1 in the sandy loam). Water repellency included both water drop penetration time (WDPT) and minimum molarity of the ethanol droplet at which rapid infiltration into the soil occurs. The BC was produced by slow pyrolysis of corn cobs at a temperature of 350 °C. Biochar, added homogeneously to the upper 7 cm of the soil, reduced the penetration resistance of surface soil of sandy loam with both the crust intact (-2.1  ± 0.6 N cm-2 per percent BC added; p = 0.001 in March 2015 and slightly smaller in October 2014) and the crust removed (-2.9  ± 0.6 N cm-2 per percent BC added; p = 0.0001). This effect occurred irrespective of particle size of BC (p > 0.05). No effect of BC on penetration resistance was found in the loamy fine sand (p > 0.05). In dry sandy loam with moisture content <1% v/v, the proportion of wettable crusted surface was significantly smaller (25%) than in moist soil (98%) with moisture content of  10% v/v. Only fine BC of <0.5 mm increased WDPT of the crusted surface of sandy loam (p < 0.05), reducing the proportion of wettable surface from 98 to 80% in moist soil and from 25 to 18% in dry soil. Coarser BCs, instead, increased the proportion of wettable crusted surface from 25% to 45% and 90% for 3% 0.5–1 mm BC and 4% 1–5 mm BC addition, respectively, in dry soil. Biochar significantly reduced Ksat (p < 0.05) in sandy loam below the crust by 0.17  ± 0.07 cm h-1 per percent BC added. However, no effect was found in loamy fine sand. Since BC amended sandy loam below the crust showed no water repellency, reduction in Ksat cannot be explained by water-repellent nature of BC. Instead, this may be due to clogging of soil pores by BC or to collapse of soil structure near water saturation. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Zambia,Zambia,Zambia,TRUE,,Maize,maize,maize,TRUE,,Biochar,biochar,"no-till, conventional tillage, biochar application, water drop penetration time, minimum molarity of the ethanol droplet, particle size variation","no-till, conventional tillage, biochar",FALSE,major,FALSE,major,Resilience,Physical,Soil Quality,Soil Moisture,"soil crusting, penetration resistance, water repellency, saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ksat), soil organic carbon, water infiltration","water infiltration, saturated hydraulic conductivity, soil organic carbon","soil crusting, penetration resistance, water repellency, saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ksat), soil organic carbon, water infiltration",TRUE,,FALSE,minor
NJ0134,"This study was conducted to evaluate the effect of different irrigation regimes on soil water dynamics and temporal associations with other water-atmospheric variables in a tomato field under different drip irrigation regimes in southwestern Nigeria. The experiment was 3x3 randomized complete block design with a split plot arrangement of treatments in three replicates. Irrigation frequencies of applying water every 7, 5 and 3 days designated as F1, F2, and F3, respectively serve as the main plot of the experiment while irrigation depth of 100%, 75% and 50% of crop water requirement (ET c ) designated as D1, D2 and D3 are the sub-plots. During the growing season, soil water storage (SWS) was monitored in soil depths of 0-5, 5-10, 10-20 and 20-30 cm using oven dry method while daily rainfall and crop evapotranspiration (ET c ) were obtained using rain gauge and daily weather data, respectively. Both classical statistics and time series (state-time) analyses were applied to the data of SWS, P (rainfall + irrigation) and ET c . Irrigation water regimes significantly (p<0.05) affected SWS. The water stored was highest in the combination of three days interval and 100% ET c while it was least in the combination of 7 day (weekly) interval and 50% ET c . There was high amplitude of temporal variability of soil water storage while the maximum SWS was obtained in all depths at 86 days after planting of tomato. There was strong temporal association between SWS and ET c but not with P. Classical regression of SWS from combinations of P and ET gave low values of coefficient of determination (R 2 ) (not more than 28.4%) while about 4 times as that value was obtained from state-time analysis. Employing the state-time approach, the effect of irrigation on soil water dynamics and how stored water is related to other variables was clearly recognized. Therefore, the state-time approach can be a specialized statistical tool for evaluating temporal associations among soil properties and processes under different management scenarios. © 2018, Int.

A randomized split-block design of field plots with compaction levels as the main block and the mulching levels as the sub-block was used. The compaction treatment consisted of 0, 5, 10 and 15 passes of a tractor with a 31 kPa contact pressure while the mulching treatment consisted of 0%, 30%, 60% and 90% areal ground cover. The zero percent treatment served as control and each treatment was replicated twice. The soil dry bulk density, penetration resistance, soil moisture content and crop growth and yield parameters were measured. Results showed that compaction level significantly increased the dry bulk density, penetration resistance and reduced soil moisture content, crop growth and yield parameters; while mulching significantly increased soil moisture content, dry bulk density and reduced penetration resistance (P<0.05). The growth and yield parameter increased for 30% mulch cover and thereafter reduced for 60% and 90% mulch cover.

This study was carried out to investigate the effect of Cocoa Husk Powder (CHP) and Cow dung on soil physical properties (i.e., moisture content and soil infiltration rate) at Ho Polytechnic demonstration field. Four beds each were raised for moisture content and infiltration rates, respectively using sandy soils. Equal volumes of water and different quantities of CHP and Cow dung were applied to the beds using Completely Randomized Design (CRD). In all, 12 soil samples each were taken from both CHP and Cow dung treatment beds for analysis of moisture content using a gravimetric method. Double infiltrometer test was used to determine the infiltration rates. The results indicated that, for the CHP soil bed, treatment 1 (no CHP) had mean moisture content of 4.5%, treatment 2 (mixed with 2 kg CHP) had 7.0%, treatment 3 (mixed with 4 kg CHP) had 8.4% and treatment 4 (mixed with 6 kg CHP) had 13% while that of the corresponding cow dung treatments were 4.4, 5.4, 7 and 11%, respectively. The basic infiltration rates recorded were 36, 33 and 21 mm h_1 (with a cumulative infiltration of 58, 52 and 45 mm) for CHP for treatments 2, 3 and 4 while that of cow dung correspondingly were 39, 33 and 27 mm h_1 (with a cumulative infiltration of 69, 61 and 55 mm), respectively. The result shows that the more you applied the cocoa husk powder, the greater the moisture content and less infiltration rate.

LM0002,"Food security is a concern in many parts of the tropics, but it is an acute problem in a band of countries bordering the Sahara desert on the south-Sub- Saharan Africa. Crop productivity and production, stability, and resilience to adverse events seem to be diminishing with time. Low productivity is related to both adverse soil conditions and insufficient rainfall amounts and distribution. Portions of the region receive substantial amounts of rainfall, yet much is lost during intense storms. A rainfall capturing technology ""Amenagement en courbes de niveau'' (ACN), a variant of closely spaced, narrow-base terraces, has been developed in Mali and has proven beneficial in several West African countries. A field where ACN had been installed was instrumented to quantify the effects of ACN on soil/water availability. Capacitance probes were installed to 160 cm so that soil moisture measurements could easily be taken two to three times a week during 2 years-2003 and 2004. Soil moisture profiles indicated that substantially more water was retained in soils where the ACN technology was installed than where it was not present. The ACN technology led to increased soil moisture during the first month of rains. However, the differences in soil moisture were greatest at the end of the rainy season when soil moisture of the subsoil was much greater where the ACN technology had been implemented.

HK0281,"Planting basins and ripper tillage practices are major components of the recently introduced conservation agriculture package that is being extensively promoted for smallholder farming in Zimbabwe. Besides preparing land for crop planting, these two technologies also help in collecting and using rainwater more efficiently in semi-arid areas. The basin tillage is being targeted for households with limited or no access to draught animals while ripping is meant for smallholder farmers with some draught animal power. Trials were established at four farms in Gwanda and Insiza in southern Zimbabwe to determine soil water contributions and runoff water losses from Plots under four different tillage treatments. The tillage treatments were hand-dug planting basins, ripping, conventional spring and double ploughing using animal-drawn implements. The initial intention was to measure soil water changes and runoff losses from cropped plots under the four tillage practices. However, due to total crop failure, only soil water and runoff were measured from bare plots between December 2006 and April 2007. Runoff losses were highest under conventional ploughing. Planting basins retained most of the rainwater that fell during each rainfall event. The amount of rainfall received at each farm significantly influenced the volume of runoff water measured. Runoff water volume increased with increase in the amount of rainfall received at each farm. Soil water content was consistently higher under basin tillage than the other three tillage treatments. Significant differences in soil water content were observed across the farms according to soil types from sand to loamy sand. The basin tillage method gives a better control of water losses from the farmers' fields. The planting basin tillage method has a greater potential for providing soil water to crops than ripper, double and single conventional Ploughing practices. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

AN0090,"Adoption of conservation agricultural practices, reduced tillage and crop rotation in the grain-producing areas of the Western Cape, South Africa, resulted in a gradual build-up of organic matter on the soil surface. It was expected that the increase in organic matter cover would influence soil water content and nitrogen mineralisation potential of the topsoil. The effect of crop rotation and tillage practice on soil water (g g -1 ) and mineral-N content (mg kg-1) in the 0-200-mm soil layer during 2010 and 2011 was assessed. Crop rotation, wheat monoculture (WWWW), lupin-wheat-canola-wheat (LWCW) and wheat-medic rotation (McWMcW) and tillage, conventional-Till (CT), minimum-Till (MT), no-Till (NT) and zero-Till (ZT) were studied. Crop rotation did not influence soil moisture content. Soil water content in CT tended to be lower compared with the other tillage treatments tested. A tendency of higher mineral-N in CT was observed, although not for all sampling dates. Mineral-N content did not differ between ZT, NT and MT. It is concluded that tillage influenced soil water and mineral-N content, whereas crop rotation only influenced mineral-N if the system included a legume crop (medic).

HK0147,"The interaction of land use and seasonal microclimatic events could explain the differences in soil quality characteristics which mediate biological and physical processes of the soil under low input land use systems (plough plus harrow, strip/heap tillage, manual clearing/no till). It is hypothesised that in a humid tropical Alfisol, low input system involving reduced tillage methods, and mineral fertilizer and/or livestock manure use, would support a higher density of microbial biomass, soil aggregation, organic C and total N and hence improvement in soil quality. The dynamics of biotic and abiotic soil properties as affected by methods of seedbed preparation characterised by manural input and microclimatic transitions from wet to dry season was studied in a maize field in a tropical rainforest Alfisol in Akure, a humid rainforest zone of Nigeria. Each year, trials were carried out during the rainy (April-July) and late (September-December) seasons of 2001 and 2002. Methods of seedbed preparation involving plough plus harrow, strip/heap tillage and no tillage, and addition of different gradients of manures (mineral N and/or plant debris and livestock litter) were imposed on the soil at the site of the experiment (of comparable physical properties of bulk density and texture). Among the treatments, there were significant differences in the values of water holding capacity, aggregate stability (macro-aggregation), concentrations of microbial biomass, organic C, total and mineral N and CEC. In the rainy and late season trials, the strip/heap tillage and the no till treatments improved aggregate stability (as measured by the percentages of aggregates between 2 and 10 mm of soil) and water holding capacity over plough + harrow. For example, in the rainy season trial, under treatments involving strip/heap tillage and the no till alone and in combination with livestock manuring and residue retention, the values of aggregates between 2 and 10 mm range from (110-116; 113-119 g/kg) and water holding capacity (0.11-0.14; 0.12-0.15 g/g) over plough + harrow (107.3 g/kg; 0.11 g/g). Similar trends were found in the values of soil microbial biomass C (377, 353; 547, 490 mu g/g dry soil), soil organic C (3.8, 4.3; 5.2,5.5 g/g) and total N (2.9, 2.3; 2.9, 3.0 mg/g) for strip/heap and no till treatments compared to plough + harrow (327.6 mu g/g dry soil; 3.4 g/g; 2.8 mg/g). Although the %C microbial to C organic ratio (an indicator of the utilisation of organic carbon by the microbes in terms of organic matter turnover rate) was stable for all treatments, its magnitude was not constant but increased with increases in soil C concentration. The values of microbial biomass carbon to organic carbon (Cmic:; Corg) ratio were higher under ploughing and heap tillage combined with mineral N (0.096, 0.099) than in no-till treatment (0.083) in the rainy season trial. Similar trends were obtained in the magnitudes of this parameter in the late season trial. Microbial biomass correlated positively with both soil organic C (y = 0.393c - 6.7; r(2) = 0.99; P < 0.05) and water holding capacity (y = 0.87c(0.39); r(2) = 0.94; P < 0.05) and negatively with bulk density (y = -0.3c + 1.9; r(2) = 0.90; P < 0.05), strong positive linear correlation were also found between soil macro aggregates and other soil properties:; microbial biomass C (y = 0.41c - 18.4; r(2) = 0.95;P < 0.05), organic C (y = 0.61c - 14.3; r(2) = 0.97; P < 0.05) and total N (y = 0.063c - 10.8; r(2) = 0.98; P < 0.05). Huge responses of soil caracteristics were obtained from low input land use systems (plough plus harrow, strip/heap tillage, manual clearing/no till). These properties mediate many biological and physical processes of soil carbon, N mineralisation, soil aggregation and water holding capacity and microbial biomass, and led to improvement in soil quality.

JS0348,"Conservation agriculture based on no-tillage (CA/NT) becomes a current tendency to enhance crop productivity by improving: (i) soil quality, (ii) water management and (iii) organic supply. In Tunisia, the applicability of CA was poorly documented. This study was carried out to evaluate changes in soil organic matter (SOM) and water properties generated by seven (NT7) and three (NT3) years of applying NT as compared to conventional tillage (CT). On three adjacent large plots, a field experiment was established since the growing season 2000/01 under rain-fed conditions on a clay loam soil in a dry subhumid zone of North Tunisia. In NT3 plot, a cultivation of wheat/fava bean sequence was investigated and residues biomass of 500 kg ha-1 and 450 kg ha-1 were left on the soil surface for wheat and fava bean, respectively. In NT7 plot, a cultivation of wheat/sulla sequence was investigated and residues biomass of 500 kg ha-1 and 700 kg ha-1 were left on the soil surface for wheat and sulla, respectively. However for the CT plot, a moldboard plowing at approximately 20 cm depth was managed for continuous wheat production. The selected key parameters evaluated for a 0–30 cm soil profile were SOM, bulk density (BD), total porosity (TP), macro-porosity (MP), micro-porosity (mP), soil water retention at field capacity (FC) and at permanent wilting point (PWP), available water content (AWC) and soil moisture content (SMC). NT7 have increased significantly (p < 0.05) levels of SOM at the top 30 cm soil layer, which in turn enhanced BD and TP of soil as compared to CT. However, improvement of these parameters was restricted to 0–10 cm layer with NT3. Both NT3 and NT7 have increased considerably (p < 0.05) mP at 0–30 cm thereby increasing soil water content at FC and PWP, whereas MP was remarkably reduced by NT treatments as compared to CT but reduction was less important in NT7 plot. AWC was significantly (p < 0.05) higher in NT7 across the 30 cm profile while NT3 and CT have similar effect to each other. SMC was improved at different soil depths by NT system during the whole agricultural season and the highest content was found with NT3. Soil moisture values increased with increasing soil depth in both NT3 and NT7 indicating a good water infiltration induced by these treatments. Hence, water storage properties in rooting zone could be enhanced by NT7 and NT3 but water availability for plants was more important with NT7. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.",Tunisia,Tunisia,Tunisia,TRUE,,"Unspecified Fodder (Grass)-Wheat, Broad or Fava Bean-Wheat","wheat, fava bean, sulla","wheat, fava bean, sulla",TRUE,,Crop Rotation-Mulch-Reduced Tillage,reduced tillage,"no-tillage, conventional tillage","no-tillage, conventional tillage",TRUE,,TRUE,,Resilience,Physical,Soil Quality,"Soil Moisture, Soil Organic Matter","soil organic matter, bulk density, total porosity, macro-porosity, micro-porosity, soil water retention, available water content, soil moisture content","soil organic matter, soil moisture","soil organic matter, soil moisture",TRUE,,TRUE,

AN0115,"Tef crop shares the largest area of production in Ethiopia. However, its productivity is lower than 0.7 ton ha(-1) which is mainly related to low soil fertility and moisture. An experiment was conducted using tef on Chromic Cambisols for two rainy cropping seasons (2008-2009) in northern Ethiopia. The objective was to assess the short-term effects of tillage frequencies on selected soil properties under continuous tef cropping system. The layout of the experiment was randomized complete block design using three tillage treatments, namely, conventional plowing (T1), four times plowing (T2), and reduced plowing (T3). A statistically significant (P <= 0.05) effect of tillage treatments on soil moisture (SM) was determined during the experimental periods. SM was higher in T2 in both years followed by T3 in 2009. Soil physical properties (bulk density, BD; total porosity, TP; soil structural stability index, SSI) and soil nutrients (total nitrogen, TN; organic carbon, OC; cation exchange capacity, CEC; potassium, K) were significantly deteriorated by the application of T1 for consecutive two-years. The Paired-Samples T-Test showed significant improvements in these soil parameters due to T2 and T3 in 2009 as compared to the corresponded values in 2008. For example, there were significant increments in SM (11%), TP (18%), SSI (12%), TN (1.2 times), phosphorous (5%), OC (13%), and CEC (15%); but significantly decreased in OC: TN (48%) and BD (4%). Generally, despite the non-significant differences between the effects of T2 and T3, higher TP, SSI, OC, CEC; and lower BD were observed by T3 in 2009. Based on such short-term results of T3 it is possible to forecast its significant long-term effects on soil properties. Thus, for sustainable use of soil systems in the long-term due attention should be given to practice T3 as soil and water management practice in the study area conditions. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AN0110,"Olive trees are grown under high evaporative demand and less precipitations that are variable in time and space especially in semi-arid conditions. The objective of this work is to determine the most efficient water treatment applied in an olive field (Olea europaea L. cv Chemlali) from the 98th to the 294th Julian day, in Tunisian semi-arid conditions. The choice of this time frame was done to control the effect of irrigation on the trees behavior in the irrigation period of the year (from April to October) and determine the most sensitive phenological stages to irrigation. For this reasons, two water treatments were applied: T100% (irrigation at 100% of Available Water Content (AWC)) and T50% (irrigation at 50% AWC). The results show that, according to leaf water potential, carbon isotope discrimination, and olive production parameters, the T50% AWC water treatment is the most efficient.

JS0130.2,"The increasing demand for irrigation water to secure food for growing populations with limited water supply suggests re-thinking the use of non-conventional water resources. The latter includes saline drainage water, brackish groundwater and treated waste water. The effects of using saline drainage water (electrical conductivity of 4.2-4.8 dS m(-1)) to irrigate field-grown tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill cv Floradade) using drip and furrow irrigation systems were evaluated, together with the distribution of soil moisture and salt. The saline water was either diluted to different salinity levels using fresh water (blended) or used cyclically with fresh water. The results of two seasons of study (2001 and 2002) showed that increasing salinity resulted in decreased leaf area index, plant dry weight, fruit total yield and individual fruit weight. In all cases, the growth parameters and yield as well as the water use efficiency were greater for drip irrigated tomato plants than furrow-irrigated plants. However, furrow irrigation produced higher individual fruit weight. The electrical conductivity of the soil solution (extracted 48 h after irrigation) showed greater fluctuations when cyclic water management was used compared to those plots irrigated with blended water. In both drip and furrow irrigation, measurements of soil moisture one day after irrigation, showed that soil moisture was higher at the top 20 cm layer and at the location of the irrigation water source; soil moisture was at a minimum in the root zone (20-40 cm layer), but showed a gradual increase at 40-60 and 60-90 cm and was stable at 90-120 cm depth. Soil water content decreased gradually as the distance from the irrigation water source increased. In addition, a few days after irrigation, the soil moisture content decreased, but the deficit was most pronounced in the surface layer. Soil salinity at the irrigation source was lower at a depth of 15 cm (surface layer) than that at 30 and 60 cm, and was minimal in deeper layers (i.e. 90 cm). Salinity increased as the distance from the irrigation source increased particularly in the surface layer. The results indicated that the salinity followed the water front.

NJ0136,"Soil texture modulates the response of ammonia-oxidizing bacterial (AOB) and archaeal (AOA) communities to biochemical quality of organic inputs in tropical agricultural soils. To verify this assumption, we used the soil organic matter long-term field experiments in Kenya established on contrasting soils (i.e., clayey Humic Nitisol, sandy Ferric Alisol) in 2002. Since the start of the experiments, soils were continuously treated (4 Mg C ha-1 year-1) with biochemically different organic inputs including Tithonia diversifolia (TD; C/N ratio: 13, Lignin: 8.9%; Polyphenols: 1.7%), Calliandra calothyrsus (CC; 13; 13; 9.4) and Zea mays stover (ZM; 59; 5.4; 1.2). In 2013, soils (0–15 cm) were sampled at young growth (EC30) and flowering (EC60) stages of maize and subjected to DNA-based community analysis of AOB, AOA and 16S rRNA genes. Soil texture exerted stronger effects on the dynamics of the assayed genes than organic input quality with AOB being more responsive than AOA. Clayey soil with its predominant soil organic matter background and large surface area of clay minerals revealed generally higher AOB and AOA abundance than the sandy soil. In the sandy soil, N-rich TD and cellulose-rich ZM promoted AOB abundance, while it was decreased under CC due to N limitation induced by high contents of polyphenols and lignin. N limitation under ZM revealed a clear community differentiation of AOB between ZM versus TD and CC in the clayey soil. For the sandy soil, AOA community composition was distinct between CC versus TD and ZM. To provide a more detailed mechanistic understanding of active AOB and AOA in response to organic input quality, we recommend for prospective research RNA-based along with enzymatic analyses as complement to those shown in this study.

JS0435,"The mineralisation of green manure from agroforestry trees was monitored with the objective to compare the temporal dynamics of mineralisation of litter from different species. Green manures from five agroforestry tree species were used on a fallow field during the long rainy season of 1997 (March-August) and from two species in the following short rainy season (September-January) in western Kenya. Different methods, i.e. measurements of isotopic ratios of C in respired CO2 and of soil organic matter (SOM) fractions, soil inorganic N and mass loss from litterbags, were used in the field to study decomposition and C and N mineralisation. Soil respiration, with the separation of added C from old soil C by using the isotopic ratio of C-13/C-12 in the respired CO2, correlated well with extractable NH4+ in the soil. Mineralisation was high and very rapid from residues of Sesbania sesban of high quality [e.g. low ratio of (polyphenoI+lignin)/N] and low and slow from low quality residues of Grevillea robusta. Ten days after application, 37% and 8% of the added C had been respired from Sesbania and Grevillea, respectively. Apparently, as much as 70-90% of the added C was respired in 40 days from high quality green manure.

NN0193.1,"A litter bag technique was used to study the decomposition and release of N, P, K, Ca, and Mg from Leucaena leucocephala and L. pallida prunings and cattle manure in a hedgerow intercropping trial conducted in the Ethiopian highlands. Hedgerow intercropping (also called alley cropping or alley farming) is an agroforestry system in which trees are grown in dense hedges between alleys where short-cycle crops are grown. The hedges are pruned periodically during the cropping period and the prunings are added to the soil as green manure. Manure was the most resistant to decomposition, losing only 15% of its dry matter (DM) in 15 weeks, compared to 41-57% lost by Leucaena prunings. Large quantities of K (up to 104 kg ha(-1)) were mineralized from prunings and manure, but Ca and Mg were mostly immobilized. More N and P were released From prunings than from manure, which resulted in net immobilization of these nutrients in the initial stages of decomposition and net mineralization in later stages. Between the leucaenas more N was mineralized and less Ca and Mg were immobilized when L. leucocephala prunings were applied than when L. pallida prunings were applied. Fertilizer N increased DM decomposition and N mineralization. Mineralization of the nutrients was constrained by lignin and polyphenol contents. It is concluded that leucaena mulch and cattle manure may be significant sources of N and K for crop growth, but external sources of P, Ca and Mg may be required, particularly in acid soils which have low contents of these nutrients.

HK0202.2,"This study tested the hypothesis that incorporation of green leaf manure (GLM) from leguminous trees into agroforestry systems may provide a substitute for inorganic N fertilisers to enhance crop growth and yield. Temporal and spatial changes in soil nitrogen availability and use were monitored for various cropping systems in southern Malawi. These included Gliricidia sepium (Jacq.) Walp. trees intercropped with maize (Zea mays L.), with and without pigeonpea (Cajanus cajan L.), sole maize, sole pigeonpea, sole gliricidia and a maize + pigeonpea intercrop. Soil mineral N was determined before and during the 1997/1998, 1998/1999 and 1999/2000 cropping seasons. Total soil mineral N content (NO3- + NH4+) was greatest in the agroforestry systems (p < 0.01). Pre-season soil mineral N content in the 0-20 cm horizon was greater in treatments containing trees (<= 85 kg N ha(-1)) than in those without (< 60 kg ha(-1); p < 0.01); however, soil mineral N content declined rapidly during the cropping season. Uptake of N was substantially greater in the agroforestry systems (200-270 kg N ha(-1)) than in the maize + pigeonpea and sole maize treatments (40-95 kg N ha(-1); p < 001). Accumulation of N by maize was greater in the agroforestry systems than in sole maize and maize + pigeonpea (p < 0.01); grain accounted for 55% of N uptake by maize in the agroforestry systems, compared to 41-47% in sole maize and maize + pigeonpea. The agroforestry systems enhanced soil fertility because mineralisation of the applied GLM increased pre-season soil mineral N content. However, this could not be fully utilised as soil N declined rapidly at a time when maize was too small to act as a major sink for N. Methods for reducing losses of mineral N released from GLM are therefore required to enhance N availability during the later stages of the season when crop requirements are greatest.

JS0023,"In cropping systems with limited amounts of external inputs, the soil organic matter pool (SOM) may contribute significantly to plant nutrition. The impact of organic inputs on total SOM and particulate organic matter (POM) N contents as affected by soil type and the relationships between sources of N and maize N uptake were assessed for a set of alley cropping trials in the West-African moist savanna. The trials were established in Niaouli (Benin Republic), in Glidji, Amoutchou, and Sarakawa (Togo), and in Bouake and Ferkessedougou (Cote d' Ivoire). The total soil N content, averaged over all treatments and years, varied between 324 and 1140 mg N kg(-1) soil. The POM-N content varied between 50 and 160 mg N kg(-1) soil. The average proportion of soil N belonging to the POM pool ranged between 9% and 29%. This was significantly related to the annual N inputs from maize stover and prunings, when averaged over the different alley cropping treatments. The trial 'age' also appeared to be related to the impact of the different treatments on the POM-N content. The Ferkessedougou soil contained a relatively higher proportion of total soil N in the POM pool because of its relatively high silt and clay content, compared to the other sites. The relative change in POM-N content between 1996 and the initial sampling was about twice the relative change in total soil N content. This suggests that N incorporated in the POM is relatively labile, compared to N incorporated in the other SOM fractions. Maize N uptake was related to the amount of add pruning-N (partial r(2) of 27%), the rainfall during the growing season (partial r(2) of 17%), the POM-N content (partial r(2) of 14%), and to a lesser degree to the POM N concentration (partial r(2) of 5%), the fertilizer N addition rate (partial r(2) of 3%), and the silt and clay content of the soil (partial r(2) of 3%).

JS0086,"Farm product diversification, shade provision and low access to fertilizers often result in the purposeful integration of upper canopy trees in cocoa (Theobroma cacao) plantations. Subsequent modification to light and soil conditions presumably affects nutrient availability and cocoa tree nutrition. However, the level of complementarity between species requires investigation to minimize interspecific competition and improve resource availability. We hypothesized beneficial effects of upper canopy trees on cocoa biomass, light regulation, soil fertility and nutrient uptake. We measured cocoa standing biomass and soil nutrient stocks under no shade (monoculture) and under three structurally and functionally distinct shade trees:; Albizia zygia (D.C.) Macbr, a nitrogen fixer; Milicia excelsa (Welw.), a native timber species; and Newbouldia laevis (Seem.), a native small stature species. Vector analysis was employed to diagnosis tree nutrition. Cocoa biomass was higher under shade (22.8 for sole cocoa versus 41.1 Mg ha(-1) supercript stopfor cocoa under Milicia), and declined along a spatial gradient from the shade tree (P < 0.05). Percent canopy openness differed between the three shade species (P = 0.0136), although light infiltration was within the optimal range for cocoa production under all three species. Soil exchangeable K was increased under Newbouldia, while available P decreased and total N status was unaffected under all shade treatments. Nutrient uptake by cocoa increased under shade (43-80% and 22-45% for N and P, respectively), with K (96-140%) as the most responsive nutrient in these multistrata systems.

LM0203,"A field experiment based on the concept of organic nutrient management (ONM) was conducted in Njoro, Kenya to test the effect of improved legume fallows; crotalaria (CR), lablab (LB), garden pea (GP) and natural fallow (NF, as control) on available soil N and P, and maize performance. The experimental layout was a split plot in a randomized complete block design. The main plots were two cropping systems involving the improved legume fallows and NF preceding sole maize and maize bean (M/B) intercrop. The sub-plots were two residue management types; residue incorporation and residue removal with farm yard manure (FYM) incorporated in its place. Incorporation of LB, CR and GP residues resulted in higher concentrations of N and P in soil than NF residue and FYM incorporation in both cropping systems. Under sole maize, grain yield following LB was significantly higher (51, 28.2 and 52%) than after CR, GP and NF, respectively. In the M/B intercrop, maize grain yield following LB was significantly higher (38.5 and 28.5%) than after GP and NF with no significant differences in yields following CR and LB. Maize dry matter (DM) yields followed a similar trend. Overall, maize grain and DM yields were higher in sole maize cropping system than in M/B intercrop with an additional 0.5 - 0.6 kg ha(-1) of bean grain yield obtained in the latter cropping system.

LM0207,"Fallows with naturally regenerated or planted vegetation are important in many subsistence agricultural systems of tropical regions, but the underlying soil processes in fallows are not properly understood. We investigated N dynamics under different fallow vegetation on a Kandiudalfic Eutrudox (2372-mm rain in 16 months) and a Kandic Paleustalf (1266-mm rain in 15 months) in the Kenyan highlands. The treatments, which extended for three cropping seasons (15-16 months), were Zea mays (maize), natural regrowth of vegetation (natural fallow), planted Sesbania sesban (sesbania fallow) and uncultivated soil without vegetation (bare fallow), Inorganic N (nitrate + ammonium-N) to 2-m depth under bare fallow increased by 242 kg N ha(-1) year(-1) on the Oxisol and 54 kg N ha(-1) year(-1) on the Alfisol, indicating that N mineralization exceeded N losses. Subsoil inorganic N (0.5-2.0 m) remained relatively unchanged after three crops of unfertilized maize, which produced limited total biomass because of P deficiency. Inorganic N decreased during natural and sesbania fallows, and both fallows similarly depleted subsoil inorganic N. The fallows depleted inorganic N at 0.5-2.0 m by 75-125 kg N ha(-1) year(-1) down to a minimum N content between 40 and 80 kg N ha(-1). After slashing sesbania and incorporating the above-ground biomass with 154-164 kg N ha(-1), soil inorganic N increased within 2 months by 136 kg N ha(-1) on the Oxisol and 148 kg N ha(-1) on the Alfisol. Inorganic N decreased after cropping the bare fallow on the Oxisol with maize, indicating that inorganic N was prone to leaching during heavy rains when the maize was small. A considerable part of the N in biomass of the natural fallow was recycled. Much of the total N accumulated by the sesbania fallow was removed with the wood and the amount of N recycled was similar an the Oxisol and Alfisol. We conclude that sesbania fallows can retrieve considerable subsoil inorganic N on deep soils with high subsoil N and effectively cycle this N through its rapidly decomposable biomass to subsequent crops.

LM0290,"We investigated the impact of perennial and annuals grass species on nitrogen cycling in a Sudanian savanna of Burkina Faso. We also analysed how the local context in terms of grazing and soil properties modifies these impacts. We selected four plots differing both by the intensity of grazing by cattle and soil depth, and used soil and grass biomass N-15 as integrative indicators of N cycle. If perennials are able to foster a more efficient nitrogen cycling there should be lower N-15 abundances in their biomass and soil. If soil depth and cattle pressure significantly modify nitrogen fluxes, soil depth and cattle pressure should influence N-15 signatures. Our results suggest that perennial grasses are more conservative for nitrogen (inhibition of nitrification, less leaching via a perennial root system, slower cycling). The increase in leaf delta N-15 with N concentration is steeper in Loudetia togoensis than in the three other grasses. No significant difference was found between the N-15 signatures of the four plots. Our results on N-15 signatures and the fact that perennial grasses are much more abundant in the plots that are less grazed and have deeper soils, confirm that the switch from perennial to annual grasses is linked to a degradation in soil fertility and pasture quality. This suggests that N-15 signatures can be used as indicators of fertility. (C) 2015 Elsevier Masson SAS.

JS0104,"Long-term fertility experiments (LTFEs) are a tool to investigate the sustainability of cropping systems. The present study analyzed two LTFEs for intensive rice-based irrigated systems in the Senegal River valley at Ndiaye and Fanaye (Sahel savanna). The trials were established in 199 1, contain six different fertilizer treatments and rice is grown two times per year. Soil types are a typical Orthithionic Gleysol and an Eutric Vertisol at Ndiaye and Fanaye, respectively. The objectives of the presented study were to analyze the effect of intensive irrigated rice cropping on the soil resource base by studying the changes of soil characteristics over time and by comparing soil N, P and K pools in different fertilizer treatments. In the LTFE at Ndiaye, topsoil pH values increased significantly from 5.5 to about 6.5 and electrical conductivity was high but remained stable. Soil organic carbon (SOC) and total soil nitrogen (TSN) dropped slightly after 16 consecutive seasons but the difference was statistically not significant. At both sites, exchangeable N ranged between 1.6 and 2.8% of TSN and fixed N accounted for 5.5-8.2% of TSN, with slightly higher values in Fanaye. Treatment differences in N dose had no significant effect on these parameters. Results of delta(13)C analysis showed a decrease due to rice cropping at both sites, and the measurements indicate high turnover rates of soil organic matter. Soil analyses of total soil P and K and of different pools indicated only small changes when these elements were applied at medium quantities. In contrast, treatments with N application only showed considerable soil P and K depletion, and rice cultivation without P and/or K application cannot maintain soil fertility. The soil mining process is relatively quick for P due to the naturally low soil P status, whereas the high soil K reserves buffer even important negative K balances for decades. It is concluded that irrigated lice cultivation in the region can maintain soil fertility if at least medium P doses are applied together with nitrogen. (C) 2003 Elsevier B.V.

LM0142,"Sustainable farming in the semi-arid interior of South Africa requires the adoption of conservation practices to maintain and, if possible, increase soil fertility. The effects of some such practices on the nitrogen fertility of a hydromorphic sandy clay loam soil were examined in a field trial at Bethlehem, in the eastern Orange Free State. Soil from selected plots was analysed, after this trial has been run for 11 and 12 years, for organic carbon and total nitrogen to use as measures of soil organic matter, and for residual inorganic and mineralizable nitrogen to use as measures of plant-available nitrogen. The trial includes 36 treatments, namely, all combinations of straw burning (burnt or unburnt), three primary cultivation methods (ploughing, stubble mulch or no cultivation), two weed control methods (mechanical or chemical) and three levels of nitrogen fertilization (20, 30 or 40 kg N ha-1). The 30 kg N ha-1 level was selected, reducing the number of treatments to 12. Similar measurements were made on soil from adjacent undisturbed natural pasture sites both upslope and downslope of the trial. There was less organic carbon and total, mineralizable and available nitrogen but more residual inorganic nitrogen within than outside the cultivated area. Soil depth to the bedrock increased down the slope:; if it can be assumed, in the absence of initial samples, that soil organic matter content originally increased in the same direction, cultivation before and during the trial had considerably reduced it. Mouldboard ploughing depleted organic matter and available nitrogen more than stubble mulch, compared with no cultivation. Mechanical weed control, compared with chemical weeding, reduced available nitrogen in the surface layer of plots that had received no primary cultivation. Straw burning, compared with no burning, increased residual inorganic nitrogen at the surface in one of the two years.

JS0302,"Cocoa agroforestry is perceived as potential adaptation strategy to sub-optimal or adverse environmental conditions such as drought. We tested this strategy over wet, dry and extremely dry periods comparing cocoa in full sun with agroforestry systems: shaded by (i) a leguminous tree species, Albizia ferruginea and (ii) Antiaris toxicaria, the most common shade tree species in the region. We monitored micro-climate, sap flux density, throughfall, and soil water content from November 2014 to March 2016 at the forest-savannah transition zone of Ghana with climate and drought events during the study period serving as proxy for projected future climatic conditions in marginal cocoa cultivation areas of West Africa. Combined transpiration of cocoa and shade trees was significantly higher than cocoa in full sun during wet and dry periods. During wet period, transpiration rate of cocoa plants shaded by A. ferruginea was significantly lower than cocoa under A. toxicaria and full sun. During the extreme drought of 2015/16, all cocoa plants under A. ferruginea died. Cocoa plants under A. toxicaria suffered 77% mortality and massive stress with significantly reduced sap flux density of 115 g cm(-2) day(-1), whereas cocoa in full sun maintained higher sap flux density of 170 g cm(-2) day(-1). Moreover, cocoa sap flux recovery after the extreme drought was significantly higher in full sun (163 g cm(-2) day(-1)) than under A. toxicaria (37 g cm(-2) day(-1)). Soil water content in full sun was higher than in shaded systems suggesting that cocoa mortality in the shaded systems was linked to strong competition for soil water. The present results have major implications for cocoa cultivation under climate change. Promoting shade cocoa agroforestry as drought resilient system especially under climate change needs to be carefully reconsidered as shade tree species such as the recommended leguminous A. ferruginea constitute major risk to cocoa functioning under extended severe drought.",Ghana,Ghana,Ghana,TRUE,,Cocoa or Cacao (Pods),cocoa,cocoa,TRUE,,Alleycropping,agroforestyr,"Agroforestry, shade management, water management",Agroforestry,TRUE,,TRUE,,Resilience,Physical,Soil Quality,"Soil Nitrogen, Soil Moisture, Soil Organic Carbon, Cation Exchange Capacity","Transpiration rates, sap flux density, soil water content, cocoa mortality","soil moisture, Water Use Efficiency","soil moisture, Water Use Efficiency",TRUE,,TRUE,

The treatments were control (C), inorganic fertilizer (F) (N-P-K, 12-12-17), rice-mill wastes (RW), RW + F, poultry manure (PM) and RW + PM. These were arranged in a randomized complete block design (RCBD) with four replications. At 0, 3, 6 and 12 months after application of the amendments, topsoil (0-20 cm) samples were collected from all the treatments, dried and separated into 4.75-2.0, 2.0-1.0, 1.00.5, 0.50-0.25 and <0.25 rum aggregates classes by wet sieving. The mesoaggregates fraction (1.0-0.50 mm) made up the highest percentage of the whole soil irrespective of the treatments. From the sixth month, the treatments generally reduced the proportion of these mesoaggregates as well as those of the microaggregates (<0.25 mm diameter) while increasing those of the other sizes.

JS0318,"Agroforestry is often promoted as a sustainable agricultural practice that can ameliorate causes of declining yields, such as soil degradation. However, despite the often-stated potential of agroforestry, quantitative data on the benefits of shade trees are limited to relatively few cropping systems, particularly maize and coffee. Furthermore, agroforests are not cost-free and the benefits of agroforests might not be sufficient to outweigh these costs in all cropping systems or environments. Here we quantify costs and benefits of agroforests for cocoa production in Ghana, West Africa. Specifically, we quantified the ability of shade trees to increase soil carbon stocks and soil fertility (i.e. total soil carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus, available phosphorus and potassium, cation exchange capacity, soil aggregation, pH, and foliar nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations), and investigate if these benefits are sufficient to outweigh the negative effects of shade trees on cocoa growth and yields. We measured cocoa yields, soil fertility and carbon-sequestration under individual shade trees, and in 30 x 30 m plots that were distributed along a gradient of shade-tree cover (plot-scale). We found localized positive effects of individual shade trees on soil carbon and nitrogen content, as well as soil aggregation. However, we found no evidence for positive effects of agroforests via improved soil fertility or carbon sequestration with increasing shade-tree cover at the plot scale, a scale that more closely matches the scale at which agroforests are managed. Cocoa growth was lower under individual shade trees and decreased with increasing shade-tree cover in plots, and cocoa yields also decreased with increasing shade-tree cover. Our results indicate that the benefits of agroforestry for soil fertility and carbon sequestration in cocoa cultivation systems might not be as extensive as believed, and may not be sufficient to compensate for short-term costs to production.",Ghana,Ghana,Ghana,TRUE,,Cocoa or Cacao (Pods),cocoa,cocoa,TRUE,,Parklands,agroforestry,"agroforestry, shade trees,maize, coffee",Agroforestry,TRUE,,TRUE,,Resilience,Physical,Soil Quality,"Soil Nitrogen, Soil Organic Carbon","soil carbon stocks, soil fertility, cocoa yields, soil aggregation, leaf nitrogen and phosphorus concentrations, soil pH, cation exchange capacity, available phosphorus and potassium","Soil Organic Carbon, Soil Total Nitrogen, Soil Available Phosphorus, Soil pH, Cation Exchange Capacity","Soil Organic Carbon, Soil Total Nitrogen, Soil Available Phosphorus, Soil pH, Cation Exchange Capacity",TRUE,,TRUE,

LM0198,"Complex molecules are presumed to be preferentially stabilized as soil organic carbon (SOC) based on the generally accepted concept that the chemical composition of litter is a major factor in its rate of decomposition. Hence, a direct link between litter quality and SOC quantity has been assumed, accepted, and ultimately incorporated in SOC models. Here, however, we present data from an incubation and field experiment that refutes the influence of litter quality on the quantity of stabilized SOC. Three different qualities of litter (Tithonia diversifolia, Calliandra calothyrsus, and Zea mays stover; 4 Mg C.ha(-1).yr(-1)) with and without the addition of mineral N fertilizer (0 or 120 kg N.ha(-1).season(-1)) were added to a red clay Humic Nitisol in a 3-yr field trial and a 1.5-yr incubation experiment.

Litter quality did not affect the amount of SOC stabilized after three annual additions in the field trial. Even within the most sensitive soil aggregate fractions, SOC contents and C:; N ratios did not differ with litter quality, indicating that litter quality did not influence the mechanisms by which SOC was stabilized. While increasing litter quality displayed faster decomposition and incorporation of C into soil aggregates after 0.25 yr in the incubation study, all litters resulted in equivalent amounts of C stabilized in the soil after 1.5 yr, further corroborating the results of the field trial. The addition of N fertilizer did not affect SOC stabilization in either the field or the incubation trial. Thus, we conclude that, while litter quality controls shorter-term dynamics of C decomposition and accumulation in the soil, longer-term SOC patterns cannot be predicted based on initial litter quality effects.

Crotalaria juncea L., Calliandra calothyrsus Meissn., cattle manure, maize (Zea mays L.) stover and Pinus patula Schiede and Schltdl. and Cham. sawdust were applied at 1.2 and 4 t C ha(-1) at Domboshawa and Makoholi Experimental Stations, simulating some of the soil amendments commonly available on smallholder farms. Soils at Domboshawa are sandy-clay loams with 220 g clay kg(-1) while the sandy soils at Makoholi had < 100 g clay kg(-1). At 12-14 weeks after incorporation, organic resource quality effects on particulate organic matter (POM) C enrichment were most significant (p < 0.01) in the macro-POM (250-2,000 mu m diameter) fraction of both soil types constituting 15-30% of total soil C on coarse sand soil and 5-10% on sandy clay loam soils. The highest increases were under C. calothyrsus, manure and sawdust treatments. There was evidence of sub-soil enrichment under these two treatments on sandy soils at different sites. While no significant treatment effects were observed on the size of organo-mineral fraction, there was a significant (p < 0.05) separation of treatments in terms of potential mineralizable N from the same fraction. On coarse sands, organo-mineral fraction under medium to high-quality materials such as manure and C. juncea released similar to 50 mg N kg(-1), compared to 8-18 mg N kg(-1) from sawdust and maize stover, suggesting that such materials enhanced the N-supply capacity of this fraction without necessarily increasing its size. The same trends were observed under sandy clay loams although, in contrast to coarse sands, the high-quality materials released no more than 25 mg N kg(-1), suggesting that the added C was protected against short-term mineralization. These contrasting properties were also reflected in maize yield patterns. On sandy clay loams, a significant linear relationship between maize yield and the amount of mineralizable N in the macro-POM fraction (R-2 = 0.50; p < 0.01) was evident, while the best predictor for maize yield on coarse sands was the amount of mineralizable N from the organo-mineral fraction (R-2 = 0.86). We concluded that maize productivity on contrasting soil types hinges on different soil organic fractions and therefore require different management strategies. Sustainability of cropping on sandy soils is likely to depend on a regular supply of high-quality C materials, which enhance the nutrient supply capacity of the small organo-mineral fraction.

Soil samples were collected at 0-15 cm and 15-30 cm and tested using routine soil testing procedures. We found that there was higher SOC under CAS than coffee monocrops. When intercropped with non- fruit tree species, Robusta CAS produced higher SOC (57.564 tC/ha) compared to the Arabica CAS (54.543 tC/ha). In contrast, Arabica CAS stored more SOC (54.01 tC/ha) compared to Robusta CAS (49.635 tC/Kg) when intercropped with fruit trees like Artocarpus heterophyllus Lam. and Mangifera indica L Under the coffee monocrop systems, Robusta coffee sequestered 4.86 tC/ha more SOC than Arabica coffee. The study showed that a farmer growing Robusta coffee intercropped with non-fruit trees is likely to benefit more from soil carbon credits than a farmer growing Arabica coffee with the same trees.

Total root mass was similar under burning and trashing but under trashing there was a redistribution of roots towards the surface 0-10 cm in the inter-row space as roots proliferated beneath the trash mulch. Soil organic C content decreased in response to both increasing distance from the plant row (to a depth of 20 cm) and burning rather than trashing (to a depth of 10 cm). Declines in K2SO4-extractable C, light fraction C, microbial biomass C, basal respiration and aggregate stability in response to distance and burning were much more marked than those for organic C and occurred to a depth of 30 cm. Bulk density was greater under burnt than trashed sugarcane and was greater in the inter-row than row, particularly under burning. Heterotrophic functional diversity (measured by analysis of catabolic response profiles to 36 substrates) was also investigated. Principal component analysis of response profiles demonstrated that soils below the row and those under trashing at 30 cm out from this row were separated from the other soils on PC1 and the sample from the inter-row centre (60 cm out) under burning was separated from the others on PC2. Catabolic evenness was least for the latter soil.

The addition of NPK fertilizer had little effect on the quantities of above-ground plant residues returned to the soil, and there was no evidence that the fertilizer affected the rate of SOC decomposition. The fact that both C(3) and C(4) plants returned organic matter to the soil in all cropping systems, but in contrasting proportions, led to clear contrasts in the (13)C abundance in the SOC. This (13)C information, together with the measured SOC contents, was used to test the ROTHC model. Decomposition was very fast, illustrated by the fact that we had to double all decomposition rate constants in the model in order to simulate the measured contrasts in SOC contents and delta(13)C between the AC treatments and the no-tree controls. We hypothesized (1) that the pruning materials from the legume trees and/or the extra rhizodeposition from the tree roots in the AC treatments accelerated the decomposition of the SOC present at the start of the experiment (true C-priming), and/or (2) that the physical protection of microbial biomass and metabolites by the clay fraction on this site, having a sandy top soil in which clay minerals are mainly of the 1:; 1 type, is lower than assumed by the model.

Phosphorus fractionation data of the soils from the maize and gliricidia-maize plots indicated that the Fe-P fraction was the most dominant form of inorganic P. The addition of gliricidia prunings significantly reduced the Fe-P and Al-P forms.

HK0269,"The effects of cattle manure and inorganic N-fertilizer application on soil organic carbon (SOC), bulk density, macro-aggregate stability and aggregate protected carbon were determined on clay and sandy soils of the Murewa smallholder farming area, Zimbabwe. Maize was grown in four fields termed homefields (HFs) and outfields (OFs) because of spatial variability induced by management practices and with the following fertility treatments:; control (no fertility amelioration), 5, 15 and 25 t/ha cattle manure + 100 kg/ha N applied annually for seven consecutive years. The addition of cattle manure resulted in significant (P < 0.01) increases in SOC, macro-aggregate stability and aggregate protected carbon in clay soils from at least the 5 t/ha cattle manure rate and was comparable between HFs and OFs on clay soils. Aggregate protected carbon in clay soils was significantly higher from the 15 and 25 t/ha cattle manure rates compared to the 5 t/ha cattle manure treatment. In contrast, only SOC was significantly (P < 0.05) increased with the addition of cattle manure on the sandy soils, while bulk density, macro-aggregate stability and aggregate protected carbon were not significantly changed. Bulk density was also not significantly (P > 0.05) different on the clay soils. A significant and positive linear relationship (r2 = 0.85) was found between SOC and macro-aggregate stability, while an r2 value of 0.82 was obtained between SOC and aggregate protected carbon on the clay soils. However, no regressions were performed on data from the sandy soils because of the lack of significant changes in soil physical properties. Application of cattle manure and inorganic N-fertilizer significantly increased (P < 0.05) maize grain yield on both soil types. Results show that inorganic N-fertilizer combined with cattle manure at 515 t/ha per yr is necessary to increase maize yields and SOC on sandy soils in Murewa, while at least 15 t/ha per yr cattle manure is required on the clay soils to improve physical properties in addition to maize yields and SOC.",Zimbabwe,Zimbabwe,Zimbabwe,TRUE,,Maize,maize,maize,TRUE,,Inorganic Fertilizer-Organic Fertilizer,"Organic Fertilizers, Inorganic Fertilizers","cattle manure, inorganic N-fertilizer","Organic Fertilizers, Inorganic Fertilizers",TRUE,,TRUE,,Resilience,Physical,Soil Quality,Soil Organic Carbon,"soil organic carbon, bulk density, macro-aggregate stability, aggregate protected carbon",Soil Organic Carbon,soil organic carbon,TRUE,,TRUE,

DK0042,"Smallholder agriculture land use systems have profoundly influenced soil organic carbon stock. The study was conducted in Abuja, the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) of Nigeria, located in the Southern Guinea Savanna zone. The aim was to determine the effect of smallholder agriculture land use on soil organic carbon stock. Cashew plantation, sole maize farm and maize-cowpea mixed cropping farm were studied. The soil samples were collected randomly using an auger at 0 to 20 cm depth from the farms in all the six Area Councils (Abuja Municipal, Kuje, Bwari, Kwali, Gwagwalada and Abaji) of Federal Capital Territory (FCT). Composite samples of 48 in number were taken to represent each land use type, making it a total of 144 composite soil samples. The soil samples were taken to the laboratory for analysis and computations. Results were subjected to statistical analysis. Cashew plantation significantly had the highest soil organic carbon stock (24.84 +/- 0.225 t ha-1) followed by maize-cowpea mixed cropping farm (21.98 +/- 0.283 t ha-1) and sole maize farm recorded the lowest (13.87 +/- 0.089 t ha-1). The significant difference in soil carbon stock among cashew plantation, maize-cowpea and maize farm may be due to the differences in overall soil management practice and cropping system. Residue removal, soil erosion, intensive tillage, low rate of biomass production, low carbon input and high rate of mineralization are the factors that contributed to lower soil organic carbon stock in maize farms compared to cashew plantation. In the savanna zone of Nigeria, maize farms are subjected to continuous and intensified cultivation, coupled with no return of crop residues. The decline in soil organic carbon stock under sole maize cultivation compared to maize-cowpea suggests degradation of the soils for sustainable crop production exacerbated by climate change in the savanna. However, the maintenance of soil carbon stock and soil productivity in maize farms under continuous cultivation and changing climate could be possible by combining maize with legume plus adequate soil management practices.",Nigeria,Nigeria,Nigeria,TRUE,,Cowpea-Maize,"cashew, maize, cowpea","cashew, maize, cowpea",TRUE,,Intercropping,,"smallholder agriculture land use, cropping system, soil management practices",Crop Rotation,FALSE,minor,FALSE,minor,Resilience,Physical,Soil Quality,Soil Organic Carbon,"soil organic carbon stock, soil erosion, carbon input, biomass production",Soil Organic Carbon,"soil organic carbon,erosion",TRUE,,FALSE,major
DK0069,"In Rwanda, mulch is applied in coffee fields to control soil erosion. The objective of this paper is to quantify the effects of different types of mulch on soil properties and soil erodibility in coffee farming systems in three different agro-ecological zones of the highlands of Rwanda. The treatments consisted of five mulching systems (T1: Cympobogon spp.; 12: Panicum spp.; T3: Cympobogon spp. and Panicum spp.; T4: Eucalyptus spp. and Cympobogon spp.; T5: mixed residues) and control (un-mulched coffee - T6). The mulching systems were selected in coffee plantations to which the same mulch material had been applied annually at an average rate of 15-21 tmulch ha(-1) for at least three consecutive years before we started field experiments in 2007. We tested the effects from 2007 to 2008 on two soil types. A factorial two-way ANOVA was used to assess the effects of the application of different mulch types on the soil organic carbon, bulk density, wet aggregate stability, and soil erodibility at each site. The application of mulch significantly reduced the bulk density and soil erodibility (P < 0.001) and significantly increased the soil organic carbon and wet aggregate stability (P < 0.001), mainly at Kibirizi and Karongi. In addition, the effects of the interactions between the type of mulch and type of soil were site specific (P < 0.001). Low bulk densities and soil erodibility as well as high soil organic carbon and wet aggregate stability values were observed mainly in response to the application of a mixture of mulches, particularly T4 and T5 at rates of above 17 t ha(-1). The maximum erodibility values coincided with the lowest values of soil organic carbon and wet aggregate stability and the highest bulk density. In addition, soil erodibility was also affected by soil texture; high sand and very fine sand fractions increased the vulnerability of soils to erosion. Mulching demonstrated positive effects on soil properties and soil erodibility, but the effects were site specific, depending on the agro-ecological conditions of the study sites and the types of mulch used.

NN0070,"The fertility of sandy soils in the Sahelian zone (SZ) is extremely low. This poor soil fertility is one of the limiting factors of crop production in the SZ. Therefore, it is imperative to improve or to maintain soil fertility through various agricultural management methods. Further, it is well known that soil organic matter plays an important role in improving the physico-chemical properties of these sandy infertile soils. Therefore, it is essential to develop a suitable tool for the appropriate evaluation of soil organic carbon (SOC) dynamics in the SZ. Therefore, the Rothamsted carbon model (Roth-C) was verified in 32 treatments of two long-term field experiments with and without crop residue application. These experiments were performed by ICRISAT. The performance of the model was evaluated by statistical methods using four indices (RMSE:; root mean square error, LOFIT:; lack of fit, r:; correlation coefficient, and M:; mean difference). As a result, the predicted SOC values in the case without crop residue management decreased with time in approximately 10 cultivated years. In contrast, in the case with crop residue application, the predicted SOC remained roughly equal to the initial SOC value during the term observed. Mostly, the Roth-C-modelled values agreed well with the actual value. RMSE and LOFIT, the statistical indicators of agreement between predicted and observed values, showed a significant conformity between the predicted and observed SOC values in all the 32 treatments. This fact means that Roth-C can estimate long-term SOC dynamics of several technical options that developed with short-term trials. Moreover the annual carbon requirement for SOC maintaining can be calculate if enough number of cases was estimated. And also analysis of regional carbon dynamics was made possible with using Roth-C model.

DK0062,"In view of the importance of soil carbon (C) and the scarce data on how conservation agriculture might influence its accumulation in Southern Africa this study presents data from 125 on-farm validation trials across 23 sites in Malawi, Mozambique, Zambia and Zimbabwe. These validation trials are paired plot comparisons of conventional agricultural practice and conservation agriculture that had been established between 2004 and 2009. Traditional cropping systems vary across the study area although they all are tillage based and maize is the main crop grown. The treatments proposed on the validations trials reflect this variability in conventional practice and propose an adapted conservation agriculture option. The sites are thus grouped into four specific treatment comparisons. Bulk density and soil C concentrations were measured from samples collected at four depth layers (0-10 cm, 10-20 cm, 20-30 cm and 30-60 cm), thereafter C stocks were calculated. On the basis of the stover biomass harvest C inputs were assessed. No consistent differences in bulk density and soil C concentrations were found. Carbon stocks were found to be positively influenced by conservation agriculture only when a mouldboard ploughed maize-legume rotation was compared to a direct seeded maize legume rotation (with residue retention). Even when increases were significantly greater under conservation agriculture the order of magnitude was small (similar to 2 Mg ha(-1)). Limited C inputs, ranging between 0.1 and 1 g C kg(-1) soil yr(-1), are likely to be the major bottleneck for C increase. These results, based on on-farm validation trials indicate that there is a limited potential for conservation agriculture to significantly increase soil C stocks after up to 7 years of conservation agriculture practices, in the studied systems.

Therefore, soil organic carbon research is gaining momentum in the Mediterranean basin. Our objective is to quantify effects of no tillage (NT) and conventional tillage (CT) on soil organic carbon stock (SOCs) in three soil types (Vertisol, Cambisol, and Luvisol) within Central Morocco. Chemical analyses were used to determine how tillage affected various humic substances. Our results showed that, after 5 years, surface horizon (0-30 cm) SOC stocks varied between tillage systems and with soil type. The SOCs was significantly higher in NT compared to CT (10% more in Vertisol and 8% more in Cambisol), but no significant difference was observed in the Luvisol. Average SOCs within the 0-30 cm depth was 29.35 and 27.36 Mg ha-1 under NT and CT, respectively. The highest SOCs (31.89 Mg ha-1) was found in Vertisols under NT. A comparison of humic substances showed that humic acids and humin were significantly higher under NT compared to CT, but fulvic acid concentrations were significantly lower.

EO0044,"Intensive tillage and monocropping have adversely affected the quality of soils in South Africa through accelerated loss of soil organic matter. Two clay loam soils, a Bonheim at Burnshill and a Shortlands at Lenye, at the Zanyokwe Irrigation Scheme in the Eastern Cape province were used to evaluate the short-term effects of tillage and crop rotations on carbon sequestration and aggregate stability under sprinkler-irrigated crop production. A split-plot arrangement of treatments in a randomised complete block design was used with tillage as the main plots and crop rotations as subplots. Conventional tillage (CT) was compared to no-till (NT) under maize–fallow–maize (MFM), maize– wheat–maize (MWM) and maize–oat–maize (MOM) rotations. Carbon sequestration was monitored by measuring changes in soil organic carbon (SOC) and the stability index (SI) was used for monitoring aggregate stability. No-till had inconsistent effects on SOC relative to CT but resulted in improved soil SI on both soils, especially on the Shortlands soil. The MOM rotation enhanced SOC relative to the MWM and MFM rotations on both the Bonheim and Shortlands soils. Across tillage practices, the MOM rotation significantly increased the soil aggregate SI compared with the MWM and MFM rotations on the Shortlands and to a lesser extent on the Bonheim soils. Scanning electron microscopy revealed that soil aggregates under MOM had dense organic coatings and bridges compared with the MFM rotation, indicating the positive effect of carbon sequestration on aggregate stability.

Treatments applied for 20 consecutive years included two straw management (unburned and burned), three tillage (no-tillage, ploughing and stubble mulch) and two weed control (chemical and mechanical) methods. Samples collected from 0-50 mm depth of specific treatment combinations were analyzed for SOC, soil inorganic C (SIC), permanganate oxidizable C (POXC), cold (CWEC) and hot (HWEC) water extractable C, extractable humic substances (CEX), humic acids, fulvic acids (CFA) and SOC functional groups. Humification (HI) and polymerization (PI) indices and alkyl C/O-alkyl C ratios were calculated. No-tillage combinations demonstrated potential to reverse losses of soil C fractions in the 0-50 mm layer. Increased POXC, CWEC, CEX and CFA revealed the labile nature of accumulated SOC in no-tillage, suggesting that SOC therein could be rapidly lost if no-tilled soils were again cultivated. Although the HI and PI were not always significant, their decrease in the no-tillage combinations suggest minimal decomposition, which is a benefit in Plinthustalfs with low storage capacity. Positive correlations between SIC and SOC fractions implied that an increase in SOC fractions protected SIC, resulting in its accumulation in no-tillage combinations. Functional groups seemed to mimic fractionated SOC fractions because O-alkyl C decreased with concomitant increase in alkyl, aromatic and carbonyl C.

DK0084,"The widespread promotion of conservation agriculture (CA) in regions with weathered soils prone to phosphorus (P) deficiency merits explicit consideration of its effect on P availability. A long-term CA field trial located on an acid, weathered soil in western Kenya was evaluated for effects of reduced tillage and residue retention on P availability. Reduced tillage and residues were hypothesized to increase soil aggregation, and as a result, reduce P sorption potential, increase labile and organic P (P-o), and stimulate phosphatase activities. After 9 years (18 cropping seasons), residue management had no effect on soil aggregate mean weight diameter (MWD), soil P fractions, or phosphatase potential activities. However, reduced tillage increased soil MWD and labile soil P stocks at 0-15 cm depth. Total P was greater at 0-15 cm depth under reduced tillage, but not for 0-30 cm depth, indicating stratification of P under reduced tillage. Increases in total P at 0-15 cm depth were correlated with maximum P sorption (P-max sorption), whereas labile P increased with MWD and P. stocks. Reduced tillage also decreased pH and increased P-max sorption, but these properties were not correlated. Despite a positive association of MWD and P., weak or no changes were observed for P. and phosphatase activities, nor were there management effects on soil C stocks. Low residue retention rates (2t maize residue yr(-1)) and relatively small improvements in soil structure due to reduced tillage were likely insufficient to yield changes in P.. Fertilizer P inputs at recommended rates (60 kg P ha(-1) per season) may have also muted treatment effects on organic P cycling, though phosphatase activities were positively correlated with inorganic P fractions. The reduced tillage component of CA offers some improvements in P availability in weathered soils of western Kenya. However, relatively low soil available P across treatments suggests that CA with P fertilization may not be an optimal P management strategy for weathered soils in this region. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

HK0293,"Fallowing increases soil organic carbon (SOC) during the fallowing phase. However, this benefit is lost quickly during the cropping phase. The objective of this study was to evaluate SOC dynamics of an improved fallow-maize rotation under no-tillage (NT) and conventional tillage (CT) from time of fallow termination, through the next two cropping seasons. The treatments studied were improved fallows of Acacia angustissima (A. angustissima) and Sesbania sesban (S. sesban), natural fallow and continuous maize.

Soil organic carbon was significantly greater under fallows than under continuous maize from fallow termination to the end of the second cropping season.

HK0268,"Residue retention and reduced tillage are both conservation agricultural management options that may enhance soil organic carbon (SOC) stabilization in tropical soils. Therefore, we evaluated the effects of long-term tillage and residue management on SOC dynamics in a Chromic Luvisol (red clay soil) and Arem-Gleyic Luvisol (sandy soil) in Zimbabwe. At the time of sampling the soils had been under conventional tillage (CT), mulch ripping (MR), clean ripping (CR) and tied ridging (TR) for 9 years. Soil was fully dispersed and separated into 212-2000 mu m (coarse sand), 53-212 mu m (fine sand), 20-53 mu m (coarse silt), 5-20 mu m (fine silt) and 0-5 mu m (clay) size fractions. The whole soil and size fractions were analyzed for C content. Conventional tillage treatments had the least amount of SOC, with 14.9 mg C g(-1) soil and 4.2 mg C g(-1) soil for the red clay and sandy soils, respectively. The highest SOC content was 6.8 mg C g(-1) soil in the sandy soil under MR, whereas for the red clay soil, TR had the highest SOC content of 20.4 mg C g(-1) soil. Organic C in the size fractions increased with decreasing size of the fractions. In both soils, the smallest response to management was observed in the clay size fractions, confirming that this size fraction is the most stable. The coarse sand-size fraction was most responsive to management in the sandy soil where MR had 42% more organic C than CR, suggesting that SOC contents of this fraction are predominantly controlled by amounts of C input. In contrast, the fine sand fraction was the most responsive fraction in the red clay soil with a 66% greater C content in the TR than CT. This result suggests that tillage disturbance is the dominant factor reducing C stabilization in a clayey soil, probably by reducing C stabilization within microaggregates. In conclusion, developing viable conservation agriculture practices to optimize SOC contents and long-term agroecosystem sustainability should prioritize the maintenance of C inputs (e.g. residue retention) to coarse textured soils, but should focus on the reduction of SOC decomposition (e.g. through reduced tillage) in fine textured soils.

DK0083,"The effect of four different mulches on fruit quality was quantified, either directly via mineral nutrient contributions or indirectly, by increasing nutrient uptake efficiency in the soil. We hypothesised that fruit nutrient levels would increase more when an organic mulch, containing nutrients, was applied to the soil, with smaller/no increases when an inorganic mulch was applied to the tree row. In this paper, we concentrate on changes in fruit phosphorus (P) concentrations after application of five treatments: a clean cultivated control, an inorganic woven geotextile fabric, and organic mulches - compost, wood chips and a vermi-castings/ wood chips combination. The trial was conducted on a commercial farm, Lourensford Estate, South Africa, from October 2008 to April 2012 - on an adjacent light, sandy and heavier, sandy-silt soil. Mineral nutrient analyses of the soil, leaves, mulches and fruit were performed. Yield and fruit size were determined. Soil temperatures and soil water status were recorded hourly during the last two seasons. P concentrations did increase chronologically from the soil, then into leaves and then into the fruit after application of mulches that provided additional P to the soil. Sporadic increases in both leaves and fruit occurred, but could not always be related to treatment effects. The significant consistent increase of P levels of the vermi-castings treatment in the heavy soil is likely to be a combination of reduced irrigation volumes, as well as a treatment effect. All mulches resulted in the well-established buffering of soil temperatures, soil water content and percentage soil carbon. Based on results from this study, it is not feasible to apply mulches for the sole purpose to increase P levels in the soil, leaves or fruit of established trees - although increases were noticed from time to time. In addition to water and temperature modifying effects of mulches that would differ between soil textures and depend on the mulch source, increases in P concentrations may result. As yield efficiency is still the primary factor determining income per hectare for the producer, the decrease in yield that resulted from mulching under these conditions, will still outweigh any positive contributions of mulches. It is therefore of utmost importance to first adjust irrigation volumes to a mulch treatment before the advantageous properties of mulching will be of value.",South Africa,South Africa,South Africa,TRUE,,Apple,fruit,fruit,TRUE,,"Organic Fertilizer, Mulch","organic fertilizer, mulch","organic mulch, inorganic mulch, soil temperature monitoring, soil water status monitoring",Mulch,TRUE,,FALSE,major,Resilience,Physical,Soil Quality,Soil Organic Carbon (Change),"fruit phosphorus concentrations, nutrient uptake efficiency, yield, fruit size, soil carbon percentage",available phosphorus,"soil organic carbon, yield,P",TRUE,,FALSE,major
NN0261,"Earthworm and termite diversity were studied in 12 long-term agricultural field trials across the sub-humid to semi-arid tropical zones of Eastern and Western Africa. In each trial, treatments with high and low soil organic C were chosen to represent contrasts in long-term soil management effects, including tillage intensity, organic matter and nutrient management and crop rotations. For each trial, a fallow representing a relatively undisturbed reference was also sampled. Earthworm taxonomic richness decreased in the direction fallow > high-C soil > low-C soil and earthworm abundance was higher in fallow than under continuous crop production. Termite abundance was not significantly different between fallow and high and low-C treatments and termite taxonomic richness was higher in fallow soil than in the two cropping systems. We concluded that fewer species of earthworms and termites were favored under agricultural management that led to lower soil C. Results indicated that the soil disturbance induced by continuous crop production was more detrimental to earthworms than to termites, when compared to the fallow. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

EO0018,"Understanding the impact of long-term continuous addition of sugarcane residues and fertiliser on soil fertility is important for development of best management practices. The experiment commenced in 1939. The fertility of the 0–10 cm soil layer was affected by the management options, but neither mulching nor fertiliser impacted significantly on soil organic carbon (SOC). However, the combination of mulching and fertiliser application increased the SOC content in the 0–2 cm soil layer significantly. It also increased soil acidity, as well as the concentration of iron, manganese, zinc and silicon, whereas reducing pH, the effective cation exchange capacity and the concentration of two of the basic cations, namely calcium and magnesium, in the 0–20 cm soil layer. Fertiliser affected yield significantly. In the absence of fertiliser, mulching had a significant effect on yield. Soil moisture and yield correlated linearly. In conclusion, increasing the addition of organic matter to continuously fertilised soils accelerated soil acidification leading to the loss of exchangeable basic cations. It is, therefore, important to take cognisance of the acidification potential of added residue under a greencane harvesting (mulching) system; this consideration emphasises the need for soil conditions to be rigorously managed on the basis of regular soil analysis. © 2018, © 2018 Southern African Plant & Soil Sciences Committee.",South Africa,South Africa,NA,TRUE,,Sugar Cane (Cane),sugarcane,sugarcane,TRUE,,"Crop Residue, Mulch, Inorganic Fertilizer, Crop Residue-Inorganic Fertilizer, Inorganic Fertilizer-Mulch","mulch, inorgancif fertilizers","mulching, fertilizer application","Mulch, Inorganic Fertilizers",TRUE,,TRUE,,Resilience,Physical,Soil Quality,"Soil Organic Carbon, Effective Cation Exchange Capacity","soil organic carbon, soil acidity, iron concentration, manganese concentration, zinc concentration, silicon concentration, pH, effective cation exchange capacity, calcium concentration, magnesium concentration, soil moisture, yield","Soil Organic Carbon, Soil NH4, Soil NO3","soil organic carbon, soil acidity, iron concentration, manganese concentration, zinc concentration, silicon concentration, pH, effective cation exchange capacity, calcium concentration, magnesium concentration, soil moisture, yield",TRUE,,FALSE,major
HK0069,"The Nigerian savanna soils are low in fertility, organic matter and cation exchange capacity. The traditional method of improving the fertility and productivity of soils of the savanna is through natural fallowing which typically takes three to five years. The method is no longer suitable for most farmers because of the rapid growth of Population in developing countries and the resulting intensive cultivation of agricultural land. In this study, a short fallow technique was adopted using forage legumes. Selected soil chemical properties were also evaluated. Incorporation of most of the legume residues significantly (P < 0.05) increased soil organic carbon more than control treatment especially when 5.0 t ha(-1) of organic matter is incorporated. The application rate of 5.0 t ha(-1) gave higher soil organic carbon content than the 2.5 t ha(-1) rates. However, the incorporation of maize stover and legume residue resulted in significantly higher soil organic carbon than the initial rate of 5.65 g kg(-1). Exchangeable cations were increased by the legume incorporation more than in the control. The impacts created by legume incorporation were mostly felt at the topsoil (0-15 cm). Adoption of the technology might be hindered by the fact that these legumes do not have immediate food grain benefit like the grain legumes (i.e., cowpea and lablab).

HK0292,"Improved legume tree fallows have great potential to increase soil organic carbon (SOC), aggregate stability and soil infiltration rates during the fallowing phase. However, persistence of the residual effects of improved fallowing on SOC, aggregate stability and infiltration rates, under different tillage systems in Zimbabwe is not well documented. The relationships between SOC, aggregate stability and infiltration in fallow-maize rotation systems are also not well documented. We therefore evaluated effects of tillage on SOC. aggregate stability and infiltration rates of a kaolinitic sandy soil during the cropping phase of an improved fallow-maize rotation system. Plots that were under legume tree fallows (Sesbania sesban; Acacia angustissitna), natural fallow (NF) and under continuous maize during the previous 2 years were divided into conventional tillage (CT) and no-till (NT) subplots soon after fallow termination. and maize was cropped in all plots during the following two seasons. Aggregate stability was investigated using water stable macroaggregation index (I-ma) water dispersible clay (WDC) and using the mean weight diameter (MWD) after different wetting procedures. Infiltration rates were determined using simulated rainfall at intensity of 35 mm h(-1) on 1 m(2) Plots. Soil organic carbon was significantly higher (P < 0.05) under fallows than continuous maize. For the 0-5 cm depth SOC was 11.0, 10.0, 9.4 and 6.6 g kg(-1) for A.angustissima, S. sesban, NF and continuous maize, respectively, at fallow termination. After 2 years of cropping SOC was 8.0. 7.0. 6.1 and 5.9 g kg(-1) under CT and 9.1 9.0, 8.0 and 6.0 g kg-1 under NT for A. angustissima, S. sesban, NF and continuous maize, respectively. Aggregate stability was significantly greater (P < 0.05) under fallows than under continuous maize and also higher under NT than under CT. The macroaggregation index (I-ma) for the 0-5 cm depth was 466, 416, 515 and 301 for A. angustissima. S. sesban, NF and continuous maize, respectively at fallow termination, decreasing to 385, 274, 286 and 255 under CT and 438, 300. 325 and 270 under NT, for A. angustissima, S. sesban, NF and continuous maize, respectively, after 2 years of cropping. Percent WDC was also significantly lower (P < 0.05) in fallows than in continuous maize, and for the 0-5 cm it was 11, 10, 8 and 17 for A. angustissima, S. sesban, NF and continuous maize, respectively at fallow termination. After 2 years of cropping WDC (%) was 12, 14 15 and 17 under CT and 10, 12, 12 and 16 under NT for A. angustissima, S. sesban, NF and continuous maize, respectively. MWD also showed significantly higher (P < 0.05) aggregate stability in fallows than in continuous maize. Water infiltration rates were significantly greater under fallows than continuous maize but these declined significantly during the cropping phase in plots that had been fallowed. In October 2000, infiltration rates in the A. angustissitna and NF plots were above 35 mm h(-1) as no runoff was observed. Steady-state infiltration rates were 24 mm h-1 in S. sesban and 5 rum h-1 for continuous maize after 30 min of rainfall simulations. After 2 years of cropping infiltration rates remained above 35 mm h-1 in A. angustissima plots, but declined to 18 and 8 mm h(-1) for NF, CT and NT respectively and 12 rum h(-1) for S. sesban, CT and NT. It is concluded that legume tree fallows improved SOC, aggregate stability and infiltration rates, but these benefits accrued during fallowing dereased significantly after 2 years of cropping following the termination of fallows. The decrease in SOC and aggregate stability was higher under CT than NT. Coppicing fallows of A. angustissima were the best long-term fallow species when integrated with NT as improved soil physical properties were maintained beyond 2 years of post-fallow cropping.

LM0154,"Contour hedgerow systems consisting of various combinations of tree and grass species can be used on sloping lands to minimize erosion, restore fertility, and improve crop productivity, but there is need to evaluate the effectiveness of each system for its suitability at any locality as effective erosion control. The objectives of this study were to determine the amount of soil conserved by contour calliandra (Calliandra calothyrsus)-Napier grass (Pennisetum purpureum) hedgerows, and then develop a support practice P-subfactor for conservation planning in central Kenya. As a benefit beyond soil conservation, biomass yield and N and P retention by the hedgerows were determined. Cumulative data for five cropping seasons from 1997 to 1999 indicated that the contour hedges on 20% slope conserved more soil (168 Mg ha(-1)) than on the 40% slope (146 Mg ha(-1)) compared to the control plots. For both slopes, this was equivalent to a 0.7 P-subfactor for use by the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) model in predicting soil erosion. The N and P losses between the hedges and control were statistically significant only on the 20% slope (P = 0.05). Combined biomass yield from the calliandra-Napier grass hedges were 12 and 9 Mg ha(-1) per year and 40% slopes, respectively.

NN0172,"Although no-till (NT) is now practiced in many countries of the world, for most smallholders, the crop residues are of such a value that they cannot be left on the soil surfaces to promote soil protection, thus potentially limiting NT benefits and adoption. In this study our main objective was to evaluate runoff, soil, and soil organic carbon (SOC) losses from traditional small-scale maize (Zea mays) field under conventional tillage (T) and NT, with crop residues cover of less than 10% during the rainy season, in South Africa. Six runoff plots of 22.5 m(2) (2.25 x 10 m) under NT and T since 2002 were considered. At each plot, soil bulk density (rho(b)) and SOC content of the 0-0.02 m layer were estimated at nine pits. Top-soil SOC stocks were 26% higher under NT than under T (P = 0.001). The NT reduced soil losses by 68% (96.8 vs. 301.5 g m(-2) yr(-1), P = 0.001) and SOC losses by 52% (7.7 vs. 16.2 g C m(-2) yr(-1), P = 0.001), and differences in runoff were not significant. Dissolved organic carbon accounted for about 10% of total SOC losses and showed significantly higher concentrations under T than NT (1.49 versus 0.86 mg C m(-2) yr(-1)). The less erosion in NT compared to T was explained by a greater occurrence under NT of indurated crusts, less prone to soil losses.

We sampled two field trials in Kenya located at Embu, on a clayey soil, and at Machanga, on a loamy sand soil.

HK0277,"Soil organic carbon (SOC) is a major attribute of soil quality that responds to land management activities which is also important in the regulation of global carbon (C) cycling. This study evaluated bulk soil C and nitrogen (N) contents and C and N dynamics in three soil organic matter (SOM) fractions separated by density. The study was based on three tillage systems on farmer managed experiments (conventional tillage (CT), ripping (RP), direct seeding (DS)) and adjacent natural forest (NF) in Haplic Arenosols (sandy) and Rhodic Ferralsols (clayey) of Zimbabwe. Carbon stocks were significantly larger in forests than tillage systems, being significantly lower in sandy soils (15 and 14 Mg C ha(-1)) than clayey soils (23 and 21 Mg C ha(-1)) at 0-10 and 10-30 cm respectively. Nitrogen content followed the same trend. At the 0-10 cm depth, SOC stocks increased under CT, RP and DS by 0.10, 0.24, 0.36 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1) and 0.76, 0.54, 0.10 Mg ha(-1) yr(-1) on sandy and clayey soils respectively over a four year period while N stocks decreased by 0.55, 0.40, 0.56 Mg ha(-1) and 0.63, 0.65, 0.55 Mg ha(-1) respectively. SOM fractions were dominated by mineral associated heavy fraction (MaHF) which accounted for 86-93% and 94-98% on sandy and clayey soils respectively. Tillage systems on sandy soils had the smallest average free light fraction (fLF) and occluded light fraction (oLF) C stocks (25.3 +/- 1.3 g m(-2) and 7.3 +/- 1.2 g m(-2)) at 0-30 cm when compared with corresponding NF (58.4 +/- 4 g m(2) and 18.5 +/- 1.0 g m(-2)). Clayey soils, had the opposite, having all fLF C and N in tillage systems being higher (80.9 +/- 12 g C m(-2) and 2.7 +/- 0.4 g N m(-2)) than NF (57.4 +/- 2.0 g C m(-2) and 2.4 +/- 0.3 g N m(-2)). Results suggest that oLF and MaHF C and N are better protected under DS and RP where they are less vulnerable to mineralisation while fLF contributes more in CT. Thus, DS and RP can be important in maintaining and improving soil quality although their practicability can be hampered by unsupportive institutional frameworks. Under prevailing climatic and management conditions, improvement of residue retention could be a major factor that can distinguish the potential of different management practices for C sequestration. The exploitation of the benefits of RP or DS and the corresponding sustainability of systems need support for surface cover retention which should also be extended to conventional tillage.

After 10 years, the %C in the 0 to 600 mm soil layer of the minimum cultivated treatments increased, except in the 0 to 300 mm soil layer, in which Festuca arundinacae was established (T11), and the 150 to 300 mm soil layer, in which Vicia dasycarpa (grazing vetch) was controlled in the vine row from bud break and in the work row from berry set (end of November) (T7). The %C in the 0 to 150 mm soil layer of the cover crop treatments also exceeded the 0.9% level above which the application of N is deemed unnecessary on these soils. During the first three years the total inorganic N in the 0 to 600 mm soil layer of the treatments in which an N-fixing cover crop was sown was higher (mostly significant) than that of T1, T2, T3 and T11 during full bloom, veraison and post-harvest. Over the medium term, grazing vetch controlled chemically on the full surface from bud break (T6) caused the total inorganic N in the 0 to 600 mm soil layer during full bloom to exceed the level at which the grapevines need additional N. During veraison, this was achieved with T7. Over the long term this was achieved during full bloom with T6 and T7. During veraison, T7 gave a similar result. T3 or the use of annuals as winter-growing cover crops may supply the fertiliser needs of the grapevines post-harvest.

NN0145,"This study evaluated the impact of direct seeding mulch-based cropping (DMC), as an alternative to conventional tilling (CT), on a functional community involved in N cycling and emission of greenhouse gas nitrous oxide (N(2)O). The study was carried out for annual soybean/rice crop rotation in the Highlands of Madagascar. The differences between the two soil management strategies (direct seeding with mulched crop residues versus tillage without incorporation of crop residues) were studied along a fertilization gradient (no fertilizer, organic fertilizer, organic plus mineral fertilizers). The activity and size of the denitrifier community were determined by denitrification enzyme activity assays and by real-time PCR quantification of the denitrification genes. Denitrification activity and total C and N content in the soil were significantly increased by DMC both years, whereas the fertilization regime and sampling year (crop and mulch types, climatic conditions) had very little effect. Similar results were also observed for denitrification gene densities. Denitrification enzyme activity was more closely correlated with C content than with N content in the soil and denitrification gene densities. Principal component analysis confirmed that soil management had the strongest impact on the soil denitrifier community and total C and N content for both years and further indicated that changes in microbial and chemical soil parameters induced by the use of fertilizer were favored in DMC plots. Overall, the alternative DMC system had a significant positive effect on denitrifier densities and potential activities, which was not altered by crop rotation and the level of fertilization. These data also suggest that in these clayey soils. the DMC system simultaneously increased the size of the soil N pool and accelerated the N cycle, by stimulating the denitrifier community.

JS0412,"The effects of grazing by livestock on soil surface features, bulk density and chemical properties were studied at the completion of a 4-year grazing experiment carried out in Sadore, Niger. Grazing treatments were a factorial arrangement of two stocking rates (62.5 and 125 kg live weight ha(-1)) and four sheep:;goat ratios (0:;6, 2:;4, 4:;2 and 6:;0 animals per pasture), with two pastures per treatment and two ungrazed controls. Observations were also made in a fallow subjected to 9 years of intense and uncontrolled mixed grazing, and in a site that had been protected from grazing for 15 years. The topsoil was sampled (at depths of 0-2, 2-6, 6-14 and 14-30 cm) below shrub canopy in herbaceous vegetation and in bare soil patches within each of 20 paddocks for determination of pH, organic C, and total N and P concentrations. Soil bulk density was measured in a subset of soil profiles. The areal extent of different types of soil crusts and other soil surface features was assessed in one-half of the paddocks. Grazing resulted in a reduction (p < 0.01) and fragmentation of the area of crusted soils. However, this trend was partially compensated for by an increase of newly formed crusts. As a result, the soil infiltration index slightly increased with moderate grazing, but decreased at higher stocking rates. Compaction due to trampling was observed ih the topsoil beneath the shrub canopy and also in vegetated patches, but only under intense grazing pressure. Soil bulk density was not affected by grazing except for an increase observed below 10 cm depth at the understorey of shrubs which is therefore unlikely due to trampling. When compared to the ungrazed control, pH, organic C and N concentrations, and to lesser extent P concentration, decreased after 4 years of grazing. Soil P and pH further decreased after 9 years of very high grazing pressure. However, neither N nor organic C decreased further.

HK0318,"Conservation agriculture (CA) can sustainably address soil degradation and improve crop yields. However, the success of CA amongst South African smallholder farmers is not known. The aims of the study were to find out: (1) the extent of CA practice by the Eastern Cape smallholder farmers; (2) perceptions towards CA amongst smallholder farmers with some history of practising the technology; and (3) the impact of practised CA components on soil quality indicators. Diagnostic survey techniques and soil sampling in farmers' fields were employed to gather data from five districts of the Eastern Cape, South Africa. The most common CA principle adopted by surveyed farmers was no-till (34.81%), whilst crop rotation and residue retention were practised by only 25.93% and 22.22% of the farmers, respectively. Education level and CA training influenced the likelihood of a farmer to practise no-till farming, whilst the likelihood of farmers to retain residues was influenced by education level and access to grazing lands. Lack of appropriate equipment and costly herbicides were the major constraining factors to practising CA. Crop residue retention conflicted with the common practice of free-range livestock grazing. Cabbage, maize and beans were the most common crops of choice for the few farmers that practised crop rotations. No significant (p > 0.05) improvement on soil quality indicators was observed with CA compared to the conventional farming method.

NN0014.1,"A long-term experiment comparing no-till with conventional tillage systems across five rotations was evaluated 11 years after initiation. The objectives of the present paper are (1) to report differences in soil chemical properties (namely soil organic matter, total nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium and pH) that have resulted by converting from conventional to no-till under contrasting cropping systems and (2) to draw tentative conclusions and recommendations on fertility status and fertilizer use and management. Soil in the no-till system had increased surface soil organic C levels relative to conventional tillage regardless of rotation. In addition, depending on the rotation, the N and P content of the soil improved with no-till compared with conventional tillage. In other words, no-till has helped to retain soil organic matter (SOM), conserved more N, and resulted in increased extractable P and exchangeable K concentrations in the upper root-zone. Hence, wheat produced in a no-till system may receive more nutrients from decomposition of SOM and acidification of the seed zone. It is possible that lesser amounts of fertilizer nutrients will be needed because of the greater efficiency of nutrient cycling in no-till systems relative to conventional systems.

Among conservation tillage systems known for their improvement in yield, no-till technology was found to influence soil quality as well. Soil quality indices are also affected by wheat rotations at medium and long-terms. This paper discusses changes in selected properties of a Calcixeroll soil, including total and particulate soil organic matter (SOM), pH, total N and aggregation, subjected, for 11 consecutive years, to various conservation and conventional agricultural systems. Tillage systems included no-tillage (NT) and conventional tillage (CT). Crop rotations were continuous wheat, fallow-wheat, fallow-wheat-com, fallow-wheat-forage and fallow-wheat-lentils. Higher aggregation, carbon sequestration, pH decline and particulate organic matter (POM) buildup are major changes associated with shift from conventional- to NT system. Better stability of aggregates was demonstrated by a significantly greater mean weight diameter under NT (3.8 mm) than CT system (3.2 mm) at the soil surface. There was 13.6% SOC increase in (0-200 mm) over the 11-year period under NT, while CT did not affect much this soil quality indicator. Another valuable funding is the stratification of SOC and total nitrogen in NT surface horizon (0-25 mm) without their depletion at deeper horizon compared to tillage treatments. Fallow-wheat system resulted in reduction of SOC compared to WW, but 3-year wheat rotation tended to improve overall soil quality. Benefits from crop rotation in terms of organic carbon varied between 2.6 and 11.7%, with fallow-wheat-forage exhibiting the maximum. Combined use of NT and 3-year fallow rotation helped to improve soil quality in this experiment. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

LM0157,"Maintenance of soil organic matter through integrated soil fertility management is important for soil quality and agricultural productivity, and for the persistence of soil faunal diversity and biomass. Little is known about the interactive effects of soil fertility management and soil macrofauna diversity on soil aggregation and SOM dynamics in tropical arable cropping systems. A study was conducted in a long-term trial at Kabete, Central Kenya, to investigate the effects of organic inputs (maize stover or manure) and inorganic fertilizers on soil macrofauna abundance, biomass and taxonomic diversity, water stable aggregation, whole soil and aggregate-associated organic C and N, as well as the relations between these variables. Differently managed arable systems were compared to a long-term green fallow system representing a relatively undisturbed reference. Fallowing, and application of farm yard manure (FYM) in combination with fertilizer, significantly enhanced earthworm diversity and biomass as well as aggregate stability and C and N pools in the top 15 cm of the soil. Earthworm abundance significantly negatively correlated with the percentage of total macroaggregates and microaggregates within macroaggregates, but all earthworm parameters positively correlated with whole soil and aggregate associated C and N, unlike termite parameters. Factor analysis showed that 35.3% of the total sample variation in aggregation and C and N in total soil and aggregate fractions was explained by earthworm parameters, and 25.5% by termite parameters. Multiple regression analysis confirmed this outcome. The negative correlation between earthworm abundance and total macroaggregates and microaggregates within macroaggregate could be linked to the presence of high numbers of Nematogenia lacuum in the arable treatments without organic amendments, an endogeic species that feeds on excrements of other larger epigeic worms and produces small excrements. Under the conditions studied, differences in earthworm abundance, biomass and diversity were more important drivers of management-induced changes in aggregate stability and soil C and N pools than differences in termite populations.

LM0080,"Effects of erosion-induced degradation on soil chemical quality, plant nutrient loss in runoff water and water quality were related to slope length for a 5-year study from 1984 through 1988 conducted on tropical Alfisols under maize (Zea mays)-cowpeas (Vigna unguiculata) rotation. A total of 13 field runoff plots involved six slope lengths (i.e. 60 m, 50 m, 40 m, 30 m, 20 m, and 10 m), two tillage methods (i.e. conventional till and no-till), and an uncropped control of 25 m length. Slope length effects on soil chemical quality differed among tillage methods. Decrease in slope length had a favorable effect on soil chemical quality in the conventional till treatment for exchangeable Ca2+, cation exchange capacity (CEC) and Bray-P. The soil organic carbon (SOC) increased with decrease in slope length at the rate of 0.007 per cent m(-1) for 0-5 cm depth and 0.015 per cent m(-1) for 5-10 cm depth, and soil pH decreased with increase in slope length. Soil concentration of Bray-1 P generally increased with decrease in slope length. For the no-till treatment, however, there were no consistent trends in soil chemical quality with regard to slope length. Further, soil chemical quality was superior under no-till than conventional till treatment for 0-5 cm and 5-10 cm depths. All soil chemical properties declined with cultivation duration, with the rate of decline being more in conventional till compared with the no-till treatment. The rate of decline for the conventional till treatment was 0.396 per cent year(-1) for SOC, 0.21 unit year(-1) for pH, 0.053 per cent year(-1) for total soil N, 0.375 cmol kg(-1) year(-1) for Ca2+, and 0.41 cmol kg(-1) year(-1) for CEC. The rate of decline in soil quality with cultivation duration was consistently more for longer than for shorter slope lengths especially for SOC and soil pH. Temporal changes in soil chemical quality for the no-till treatment were not well defined. The total loss of plant nutrients in runoff ranged from 8.4 kg ha(-1) to 17.8 kg ha(-1) for season 1, and, in general, the nutrient loss decreased with decrease in slope length. The total loss of plant nutrients in season 2 was lower than that in season 1, and lower with no-till compared with conventional till treatment. Total nutrient loss in runoff decreased with increase in slope length for conventional tillage, and increased with decrease in slope length for the no-till treatment. Concentration of plant nutrient in runoff differed among elements, tillage methods and slope length treatments. Concentration of bases and NO3-N in runoff followed a U-shape response over time during the year, with relatively high concentrations toward the beginning and end of the rains. The concentration of PO4-P in runoff generally decreased with time after application of fertilizer.

Thus, this study evaluated the effects of SWC on selected soil properties in the Middle Silluh Valley, Tigray region, Northern Ethiopia. The study considered conserved landscapes (terraced hillside, terraced farmland and exclosure area) and non conserved landscapes (non-terraced hillside, non-terraced farmland and open grazing land) for comparison using a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). A total of 24 samples were collected from each landscape at a depth of 10-30 cm. The results indicated that mean bulk density (BD) was low on terraced hillside, non-terraced hillside and exclosure area. Sand and clay content were significantly different at P < 0.05 for the six landscape categories. Higher mean organic matter was observed in the conserved landscape, as compared with the corresponding non-conserved landscape. Pearson's correlation between Soil Organic Matter (SOM) and clay content, SOM and Total Nitrogen (TN) showed strong positive relationships.

NJ0133,"Land degradation such as declining soil fertility is the main cause for poverty in rural areas of developing countries due to reduced land productivity. To tackle the effect of soil degradation on agricultural production, soil and water conservation (SWC) measures such as bench terraces have been installed at large scale in Ethiopia highlands. However, the effects of such bench terraces on the evolution of selected soil properties are less studied. Thus, the overall objective of this study is to evaluate short-term effects of bench terraces on soil properties. Four terraced hillside farming sites and four adjacent control sites were purposely selected at Teshi, Ruba Feleg, Mechael Emba and Enda Chena of the Tigray region. For each selected site, three representative hillslope classes at foot slope, middle slope, and upslope positions were identified for soil sampling. Soil physico-chemical properties were analyzed using standard laboratory procedures at regional soil laboratory research center. The results revealed remarkable effects of bench terraces on rehabilitation of the degraded soils. However, its installation can also induce considerable negative impacts on soil fertility during the first few years due to soil translocation and exposure of subsoils. The results indicated that aggregate stability and soil pH values for most of the hillside farming sites have shown a significant difference (p <= 0.05) among upslope, middle and foot slopes positions and control sites which would be explained by erosion and leaching in the upslope and enrichment of base forming cations and clay at foot slope positions. High proportion of large aggregates size is observed at both Teshi and Ruba Feleg hillside farming sites compared to their corresponding control sites. The soil organic matter (SOM) content, total nitrogen (TN) and available phosphorous (Av.P) at Teshi site, TN at Ruba Feleg site, TN and Av. P at Michael Emba site and SOM and Av. P at Enda Chena hillside farming site are significantly different (p < 0.05) among the three slope classes of the sites and the corresponding control site. Moreover, mean SOM content and Av. P at Ruba Feleg site and SOM content at Michael Emba site have shown a significant difference (p < 0.05) among the three slope classes and the control sites except between upslope and middle slopes. Generally, the installation of bench terrace combined with soil fertility management practices such as application of organic manure and compost are important positive operation for changing most unproductive mountains and hillslopes into productive landscapes while contributing towards a sustainable land management in the area.

DK0057,"The aim of this research was to investigate the effect of biochar amendment on soil acidity and other physico-chemical properties of soil in Southern Ethiopia using a field experiment of three treatments: (1) biochar made of corn cobs, (2) biochar made of chopped Lantana camara stem, and (3) biochar made of Eucalyptus globulus feedstock and a control, in which neither of the biochar was used. Each treatment had three levels of 6, 12 and 18 t ha(-1). The experiment was setup with RCBD in a factorial arrangement with three replications. In this regard, a total of 36 plots (each 2 x 2 m size) were applied with three replications to the depth of 0-15cm. From these 36plots, composite soil samples were collected to the depth of 0-30 cm and analyzed for bulk density, total porosity, pH, soil organic carbon, total nitrogen, available phosphorus, potassium, and exchangeable acidity using standard procedures before and after biochar application. Two-way ANOVA was also used to analyze the impact of the biochars on soil acidity and other properties. For the treatments that had significant effects, a mean separation was made using Least Significance Difference (LSD) test. The results showed the application of biochar significantly reduced, soil bulk density and exchangeable acidity when compared with a control (p < 0.05). Moreover, the total soil porosity, soil pH, total nitrogen, soil organic carbon, available phosphorus, and potassium were significantly increased in the soil. From among applied biochar treatments, Lantana camara applied at the level of 18 t ha(-1) had a higher impact in changing soil physico-chemical properties.

AG0101,"Soil biological properties are the most sensitive soil quality indicators that respond quickly to short-term soil fertility management changes. We studied the combined effects of tillage and soil external inputs on total soil organic carbon and nitrogen, microbial biomass carbon (MBC) and nitrogen (MBN) and acid phosphomonoesterase activity (ACP). This was done in Meru South and Kandara sub-counties in Kenya for three consecutive cropping seasons. Tillage was the main factor [minimum (D-0) and conventional (D-15)], and soil external inputs were the sub-factors: sole mineral fertiliser (F), crop residues + mineral fertiliser (RF), crop residues + animal manure + legume intercrop Dolichos lablab L. (RML), crop residues + mineral fertiliser + animal manure (RFM), crop residues + Tithonia diversifolia + animal manure (RTiM), crop residues + Tithonia diversifolia + rock phosphate (RTiP) and an unfertilized treatment (Control). During the study period, we experienced frequent dry spells and meteorological droughts in the two sites. We found no significant effects of the tillage systems and mineral fertilisers applied alone or combined with crop residues on the biological properties. All additional organic inputs to the soils enhanced the biological soil properties. On average. MBC in the treatments with organic inputs only was enhanced by 51% in Meru South and 19% in Kandara. MBC-to-TOC ratio was significantly different (p - .0003) under soil external inputs in Meru South. On average. MBN in the treatments with organic inputs was enhanced by 66% in Meru South and 25% in Kandara Compared with the control, ACP was higher under RML. RTiP and RTiM by 26%. 20% and 17%, respectively in Meru South. In Kandara, ACP was higher under RTiM and RTiP by 25% and 23%, respectively, compared with the control. The increase in microbial biomass indicates that application of organic inputs contributed to soil organic C, thereby stimulating the microbial growth and enzyme activity. Thus, use of organic inputs or in combination with mineral fertilisers are feasible alternatives for sustaining soil organic carbon through increased microbial biomass leading to soil organic matter build-up, which is a vital element of soil quality and fertility.

DK0121,"This study, carried-out in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, investigated changes in selected soil properties and their effect on aggregation induced by 72 years of residue burning or mulching, with and without fertilizer application on a sugarcane trial arranged in a split-plot design with four replications. The main plot treatments were a) green cane harvesting with all residues mulched, b) cane burnt prior to harvest with cane-tops left scattered evenly over the plots and c) cane burnt prior to harvest with all the residues removed from the plots. Split-plot treatments consisted of fertilized and unfertilized plots. Soil samples for physico-chemical and aggregate stability analysis were collected at depths of 0-10 and 10-20 cm from 24 plots. In comparison with burning, significant effects of mulching were only observed on total nitrogen and exchangeable potassium and sodium, mainly at 0-10 cm. Aggregate stability estimated by mean weight diameter (MWD), exchangeable cations (especially calcium and magnesium) and pH were significantly affected by fertilizer application. An increase in acidity and a decrease in MWD and exchangeable calcium and magnesium on fertilized plots were attributed to mining of nutrients by sugarcane, nitrification and subsequent base cation leaching. The significant positive correlation between calcium and magnesium and MWD, and the lack of correlation between organic carbon (OC) and MWD, indicated that bases contributed more to soil aggregation than OC. Total carbon and OC showed no differences across all treatments. It was concluded that (i) annual fertilizer applications may lead to soil structure deterioration under sugarcane regardless of the harvesting method practiced and (ii) increasing additions of organic matter (through mulching) do not always correspond to an improvement of soil aggregate stability and related soil properties.

NJ0011,"Field studies were conducted in 2012 and 2013 in the tropical rainforest zone of Nigeria to investigate the effects of a composted, pelletised organo-mineral fertiliser applied as an organic amendment at 5 metric tonnes (MT) ha(-1) or at 10 MT ha(-1) in four replications, on soil population densities of five genera of plant-parasitic nematodes and on crop yields of Telfairia occidentalis (fluted pumpkin). The experimental field was naturally infested with Meloidogyne incognita, Tylenchus spp., Helicotylenchus spp., Hirschmaniella spp., and Longidorus spp. The compost was applied as an amendment to soil planted with T. occidentalis 3 weeks after seedling emergence. At the end of both annual experiments, the addition of compost as a soil amendment resulted in 16.25 - 65.75% reductions in the populations of all five genera of plant parasitic nematodes compared to an increase in each nematode population in the untreated control plots. There was also a higher crop yield of T. occidentalis in all eight treated plots compared to the control plots. Compost applied at 10 MT ha(-1) reduced the soil populations of all nematode species significantly, with correspondingly higher yields of the crop compared to 5 MT compost ha(-1) in both years of study. Correlation analysis showed that the population density of each nematode species had a negative effect on the cumulative leaf biomass (fresh weight) of the test crop. The results of this study suggest that nematodes constrained the production of T. occidentalis under continuous cropping and that a composted, pelletised organo-mineral fertiliser, applied as a soil amendment at 10 MT ha(-1), suppressed soil populations of all five nematodes significantly and increased yields of T. occidentalis by 109 - 366% compared to the untreated control plots.",Nigeria,Nigeria,Nigeria,TRUE,,Fluted Pumpkin,Telfairia occidentalis (fluted pumpkin),Telfairia occidentalis (fluted pumpkin),TRUE,,Organic Fertilizer,Organic fertilizer,"composted, pelletised organo-mineral fertiliser, organic amendment",Organic Fertilizers,TRUE,,TRUE,,Resilience,Physical,Soil Quality,"Soil Organic Carbon, Soil Total Nitrogen","population densities of plant-parasitic nematodes, crop yields, cumulative leaf biomass",crop yield,yield,TRUE,,TRUE,
DK0054,"Resource-conserving agriculture (RCA) aims at improving soil quality and crop yield whilst maintaining or improving soil health by minimizing soil disturbance, retaining crop residue, using crop rotations and adding in situ soil and water conservation tillage practices (terwah and derdero) in crop fields. In Ethiopia, intensive mining of soil resources using repeated tillage, complete crop residue removal at harvesting, overgrazing and biomass burning in croplands have aggravated soil degradation. We studied the impact of two RCA (derdero+ (DER+) and terwah+ (TER+) on long-term soil quality and crop productivity in permanently kept plots in northern Ethiopia 7 years after its inception. The two RCA practices: (i) DER+ is a bed and furrow planting system, where beds remain unploughed, furrows are tilled once at planting time and 30% of crop residue is retained. (ii) TER+ is ploughed once at planting, furrows are made at 1.5 m intervals, creating fresh broad beds, and 30% crop residue is retained. These RCA practices were compared against conventional tillage (CT) characterized by a minimum of three tillage operations and complete removal of crop residues. Among the several assessed soil properties, soil organic C (SOC), total soil N, available P, soil microbial biomass C (SMBC), time of ponding, aggregate stability index (SI), consistency index (CI), cone index, air capacity and macroporosity were shown to increase significantly in soils subjected to DER+ planting system compared to CT. On average, crop yields under DER+ and TER+ increased by 30 % and 16 %, respectively, as compared to CT. Thus, from an agro-ecological point of view, adopting improved local practices such as DER+ and TER+ planting systems that employ conservation agriculture principles proved to be sustainable, resource conserving alternatives and incentives should be provided to facilitate larger adoption by farmers in Ethiopia.

Thus, aggregate and particle associated SOC and TN in 0- to 10-cm and 10- to 20-cm layers were estimated for five land uses: rainfed cultivation (RF), agroforestry (AF), open pasture (OP), silvopasture (SP), and irrigation (IR) each with five replications within a watershed in Ethiopia. OP had the highest WSA>2mm (88 7%) and SOC associated with macroaggregates (20 0g kg-1), which were significantly higher (P<0 0001; P=0 0017 for WSA and SOC, respectively) than that in other land uses in 0- to 10-cm depth. SOC associated with both macroaggregates and microaggregates decreased with depth. Macroaggregates contained higher SOC than microaggregates in both layers under all land uses. AF had the highest SOC associated with microaggregates (2 6g kg-1) followed by that in SP (2 3g kg-1), indicating its potential to stabilize SOC more than other land uses.

Sand-associated SOC and TN were the highest in uncultivated systems. Moreover, the higher SOC concentrations associated with clay particles in soils under OP, SP, and AF showed that grass-based and tree-based systems are rich in stable SOC as clay-associated SOC has higher residence time than that associated with sand or silt fractions. © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",Ethiopia,Ethiopia,Ethiopia,TRUE,,Fodder (Natural Vegetation),"sugarcane, coffee",NA,FALSE,major,Silvopasture,Silvopasture,"no-till, minimum tillage, contour tillage, conventional tillage, agroforestry, mulching, fertilizer application, soil and water conservation, organic amendments","No-till, Minimum Tillage, Conventional Tillage, Agroforestry, Mulch, Fertilizer Application, Soil and Water Conservation, Organic Fertilizers",FALSE,major,FALSE,major,Resilience,Physical,Soil Quality,"Soil Organic Carbon, Soil Total Nitrogen","soil organic carbon, total nitrogen, cation exchange capacity, soil acidity, aggregate stability, infiltration rate","Soil Organic Carbon, Total Nitrogen, Cation Exchange Capacity, Soil Acidity, Aggregate Stability, Infiltration Rate","Soil Organic Carbon, Total Nitrogen, Cation Exchange Capacity, Soil Acidity, Aggregate Stability, Infiltration Rate",TRUE,,TRUE,

DK0104,"Clearing and cultivation of indigenous woodlands for agriculture may be among the most important mechanisms of physical, chemical and biological land degradation in Zimbabwe, and southern Africa in general. The objective of the study was to determine the effects of clearing miombo woodland and converting the land to maize (Zea mays L.) cropping on selected soil properties on clay (Chromic luvisol) and loamy sand (Ferric acrisol) soils in central Zimbabwe. Soil samples were collected from undisturbed, cleared and cultivated woodlands after four cropping seasons and analyzed for soil organic C, total N and P, exchangeable bases, cation exchange capacity, infiltration rate, aggregate stability and microbial biomass C and N at 0-5, 6-10 and 11-20cm depths. Results showed that clearing and conversion of miombo woodlands to croplands reduced soil nutrients, cation exchange capacity (range: 9.6-21.0cmolckg-1 in clay; 7.0-15.5cmolckg-1 in loamy sand), and microbial C (range: 0.06-0.54% in clay; 0.02-0.37% in loamy sand). The extent and nature of change was variable, depending on the soil type and depth. Clearing of trees and leaving soil surface covered with grass did not always translate to a significant decline in soil organic C after four seasons (range: 0.69-2.24% in clay; 0.24-1.43% in loamy sand), unless the clearing was followed by successive cultivation and cropping without N fertilization. The reduced soil quality under cultivation was attributed to a potential pulse in decomposition and mineralization processes caused by soil disturbance, followed by leaching of released nutrients to lower horizons. This could be aided by nutrient removal in crop parts during harvest, without adequate soil nutrient replenishment. Under the woodland ecosystem, litter-fall may help to maintain steady-state infiltration rate (range: 45-126cmh-1 in clay; 32-97cmh-1 in loamy sand) by protecting the soil surface from damage and ensuring the formation of stable aggregates which preserve pore continuity. It was recommended that when miombo woodlands are to be cleared, management decisions that reduce tillage intensity and maximize residue retention should be put into practice; otherwise the clearing is strongly discouraged. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.",Zimbabwe,Zimbabwe,Zimbabwe,TRUE,,Maize,maize,maize,TRUE,,Inorganic Fertilizer,crop rotation,"clearing, cultivation, crop rotation, residue retention",Crop Rotation,TRUE,,TRUE,,Resilience,Physical,Soil Quality,"Soil Organic Carbon, Soil Total Nitrogen, Cation Exchange Capacity, Infiltration Rate","soil organic carbon, total nitrogen, total phosphorus, cation exchange capacity, microbial biomass carbon, infiltration rate, aggregate stability","Soil Organic Carbon, Total Nitrogen, Soil Available Phosphorus, Cation Exchange Capacity, Microbial Biomass, Infiltration Rate, Aggregate Stability","Soil Organic Carbon, Total Nitrogen, Soil Available Phosphorus, Cation Exchange Capacity, Microbial Biomass, Infiltration Rate, Aggregate Stability",TRUE,,TRUE,

NN0031.2,"The cultivated soils of the Sahel are sandy, very poor in organic matter, and are prone to surface crusting and erosion. Farmers sustain pearl millet production through permanent cultivation with manure input or long-term fallowing. Due to population increase fallows are reduced bringing on low yields. This on-farm study (Banizoumbou, semi-arid Niger) examines the impact of clearing and weeding on soil surface processes, the decline in soil organic matter under prolonged cultivation, and whether manure inputs are sufficient to sustain millet production. Short-term effects were examined in a 3-year experiment with dung application (5 Mg ha(-1)) and weeding frequency (no, two and four weedings). Long-term effects were studied a 4-year experiment comparing three farming systems:; (i) permanent cultivation with manure; (ii) cultivation after long fallows >15 years; (iii) cultivation after short fallows 3-5 years. Due to the difference in scale, different processes of erosion were studied, saltation and creep in the first experiment, suspension in the second. Dung deposits provided mechanical protection of the soil surface by reducing crusting and by trapping aeolian sand. A very low cover of dung, 0.5-5%, is enough to protect the soil effectively by forming barriers against creep and saltation. Suspension occurs during tillage. Manual cultivation, while disrupting aggregates and surface crusts, enhances wind erosion and this leads to loss of clay and silt from the top soil. Changing from long to short fallow periods and even to permanent cultivation, constitutes a trend towards more intensive land use and this, eventually, leads to extremely sandy top soils (from 890 up to 934 g kg(-1)) and coincidences with a soil surface becoming less crusted (from 49% of field surface affected down to 7%). Manure input cannot prevent the erosion of fine earth which seems to be an irreversible feature of long-term cultivation. Dung inputs, 0.5-1 Mg ha(-1) per year, are insufficient to increase substantially millet grain yield (350 kg ha(-1) in manured; 300 kg ha(-1) in long fallow fields), or elevated soil organic matter (2.9 g kg(-1) soil, in manured fields; 4.0 g kg(-1) in long fallow fields, 0-20 cm). Yet grain yield remains stable under permanent cropping, while fields without manure need fallowing for long periods to restore fertility.

Soil was sampled to a 20 cm depth, post-harvest to analyze biophysical and chemical characteristics of soil organic matter, POM, POM-C and POM-N, as well as inorganic N, available P. exchangeable K(+) and particle size distribution. The gliricidia/maize intercrop had a significant and positive effect on SOM, POM, and SOM fractions:; SOM was 12% higher, POM 40%, POM-C 62%, and POM-N 86% higher in the gliricidia intercrop compared to sole maize, indicating nitrogen enrichment of POM. Nitrogen fertilizer was associated with modest increases in POM, 15% in gliricidia and 27% in sole maize. The impacts of these changes were directed mostly at increasing maize yields and increasing storage of soil nutrients over the short term, while decreasing the proportion of organic matter stored over the long term. Both the gliricidia/maize intercrop and increasing soil clay content were associated with significantly increased soil CEC.

NN0184.3,"The trial was conducted over a period of ten years (1993/94 to 2002/03) on a sandy soil in a Sauvignon blanc/Ramsey vineyard near Lutzville (31 degrees 35'S, 18 degrees 52'E), situated in the semi-arid Olifants River Valley of the Western Cape. Fourteen treatments, consisting of three cereals and four legumes, managed according to two cover crop management practices, were included. One management practice consisted of cover crops which were sown annually. Full surface post-emergence chemical control was applied before bud break and again when the berries reached pea size (BB). The second management practice consisted of cover crops which were sown biennially. Post-emergence chemical control was applied to the vine row before bud break and full surface control was applied when the berries reached pea size (AB). From 1999/2000 to 2002/03 the cover crops were sown annually, while the full surface post-emergence control applied at the end of November (berries at pea size) was advanced to mid-October. Two treatments in which Avena sativa L. v. Saia ('Saia' oats) and Vicia dasycarpa Ten. (grazing vetch) were sown annually, controlled mechanically in the work row and chemically in the vine row from bud break to harvest (MC), were also applied. These treatments were compared to a control, in which no cover crop was sown and MC was applied. A treatment in which no cover crop was sown and BB was applied (weedchem), was also included. After five years (1997/98), the soil organic matter (SOM) in the 0-150 mm soil layer of the BB and AB treatments of grazing vetch was significantly higher than that of the control and weedchem.

Two sites (with conventional tillage & traditional tillage) located southern central clay plain were selected.

Results showed that content of total mineral nitrogen NH(4)(+)-N+NO(3)(-)-N) in traditional tillage was significantly higher than that obtained under conventional tillage. Accordingly, mineral nitrogen under traditional tillage determined after 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 weeks were 366.2, 217.78, 206.12, 202.86, 189.8 kg ha(-1), respectively.

This paper is based on behaviour to tillage treatments of two Vertisols in Morocco. After 11 years of testing, soil organic matter content results showed a significant difference (P < 0.05) only at soil surface (0-10 cm) in favour of no tillage and a variation of 30% at this depth. The results obtained after 32 years of testing showed a significant soil profile difference (P < 0.05), up to 40 cm under no tillage compared to conventional tillage, and a variation of 54% at 5-10 cm. For total nitrogen, there was no significant effect between no tillage and conventional tillage at the soil surface after 11 years unlike the result obtained after 32 years. There are no significant differences in bulk density between tillage treatments at soil surface for both sites. The measurement of soil structural stability showed a significant effect (P < 0.05) for all three tests and for both sites.

NJ0069,"We investigated the effects of switching from conventional management to organic management on the abundance and community composition of soil-living oribatid mites in clover fields in an experimental agricultural station at Al-Fayoum, Egypt. The site had two adjacent fields with identical vegetation cover but different management. Fifteen random soil samples were collected monthly from each of three plots per field, from October to March. We characterized the soils with respect to various physicochemical variables as well as fungal community composition, and estimated mite densities through core sampling. Organic fields had a significantly more abundant oribatid community than did conventional fields. Also the abundance of soil fungi was greater in the organically managed field. Organic management promoted common oribatid mite species with a wide ecological amplitude that already had a high abundance where such common species are more responsive to changes in agricultural management. However, some species of mite responded indifferent or negative to the switch from conventional to organic management. Overall, the differences between the two ecological systems were mainly quantitative. Species diversities of both mite and fungal communities did not differ much between the two management systems. Diversity (H') and equitability (E) of soil oribatid communities were higher in conventional plots than in the organic plots during the first 2 months but indistinguishable thereafter. Our study confirmed that organic management stimulates soil organic matter build-up, with positive effects on both fungal and oribatid mite abundance and possible long-term effects on soil function. © 2015, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.",Egypt,Egypt,Egypt,TRUE,,Egyptian Clover,clover,clover,TRUE,,Reduced Tillage,reduced tillage,"organic management, conventional management","Organic Fertilizers, Inorganic Fertilizers",FALSE,major,FALSE,major,Resilience,Physical,"Soil Quality, Biodiversity","Soil Organic Matter, Soil Total Nitrogen, Soil Organic Carbon, Soil Moisture, Beneficial Organisms, Biodiversity","mites density, soil fungi abundance, community composition of soil oribatid mites",Biodiversity,beneficial organisms,TRUE,,FALSE,minor
AN0122,"Soil respiration is often used as an index of fertility because the majority of nutrients are cycled through the microbial biomass. We assessed the role of soil respiration as a measure of resource productivity in three long-term grassland experiments near Pietermaritzburg, South Africa. All of these experiments have shown significant changes in grass species composition and productivity. An ongoing Veld (=field) Fertilizer Experiment (VFE) that manipulated the level of nitrogen fertilizer, phosphorus and lime has been running since 1951. A Burning and Mowing Experiment (BME) has been running since 1950. The third experiment is part of the Nutrient Network (NutNet), a global fertilizer experiment that has been manipulating nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium and micronutrients and has been running since 2009. We found that longer-term experiments were more likely to show significant effects on soil respiration. We found several significant effects in the VFE but no significant differences in soil respiration among fertilization treatments in the shortest-term experiment (NutNet). In the VFE, we found significant differences in soil respiration due to levels of nitrogen fertilizer, form of nitrogen fertilizer (limestone ammonium nitrate and ammonium sulphate), phosphorus and lime. We found no significant relationship between above-ground net primary productivity and soil respiration despite the frequent detection of such a pattern due to the link between soil respiration, soil fertility and productivity. We found that, while there was a consistent increase in total soil nitrogen with increasing levels of nitrogen fertilizer applied, there was a consistent decrease in soil microbial respiration. There was a significant positive correlation between soil respiration and pH. Possible mechanisms behind this are unclear but may involve changes in dominant enzymes and possibly switches between dominance of bacteria and fungi. We also found significant effects of the timing of burning in the BME, but not due to the frequency of burning or the occurrence of mowing. Our results suggest that studies may need to be long-term, for example here at least 10 years, before key functional relationships with soil fertility can be reliably understood.

AN0061,"In the Fakara region of the Sahel zone, Niger, West Africa, farmers have been implementing traditional soil management practices such as the application of dry farmyard manure (FYM) and household waste (HHW), livestock corralling, and fallows. Previous studies, however, have not accumulated enough data on the effects of these practices on the soil nitrogen (N) pool in the Sahelian sandy soils. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the effects of these traditional practices on each N pool and on other nutrients. As the indicator of available N, phosphate buffer extractable organic nitrogen (PEON) was employed. Total N was significantly higher in the fields adjacent to houses (H) and suburban fields where FYM had been applied for 10 years (FYM10) or 5 years (FYM5), compared with that in the no-treatment fields (NT) which had received no organic matter (OM) and chemical fertilizer for several decades. FYM 10, H, and reserved fallows (RF) showed significantly higher levels of PEON than of NT. The amounts of total N and PEON in soils from all corralling practices, and all normal fallows were at the same level compared with NT. Similarly, the mineral N pool was higher for the soils from H, FYM10, and mixed corralling with sheep and goats. The principal component analyses (PCA) showed that all eigenvalues of soil pH, exchangeable potassium (K), available phosphorus (P), total N and carbon (C), PEON and mineral N in principal component 1 (PC1) were positive, thus relating strongly to soil management practices which can enhance the essential nutrients: the pool of N, P, and K, and C pool in soil. For PC2, the eigenvalues of mineral N, exchangeable K, and pH were positive, strongly relating to soil management practices which can enhance cations in soil. In comparison with NT the eigenvalues of PC1 of the managements with OM application were higher than in NT while those for the normal fallows without OM application were as low as those in NT. The eigenvalues of PC2 were higher for H and all corralling practices compared with the values for NT. We understood that the practices of transporting manure and corralling are important for the improvement of the fertility of Sahelian soils. Furthermore, the findings suggest that corralling is a more economical and useful practice than the others; livestock are moved around and drop manure directly on the farmland, thus the loss of OM in transportation and the labor requirement are also low.(C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The field experiment was a split - plot in a randomized complete block design replicated thrice. Continuous maize cropping (CM), maize/cowpea rotation (M/C) and maize/soybean intercropping (M/S) systems were considered as main plot factors. Poultry manure (PM) at a rate of 4 Mg ha-1, chemical fertilizer (CF) (NPK 15- 15- 15) at a rate of 90 - 60 - 60 kg ha-1, complementary application of poultry manure and chemical fertilizer (PM + CF) at 2 Mg ha-1 PM + 45- 30 -30 kg ha-1 CF and a control (no amendment) constituted the sub-plot factors.

AG0071,"Introduction: To estimate differential accumulation of soil organic carbon (SOC) and its ecological significance is very important to smallholder farmers in the Tanzania's semiarid areas. This study investigated the accumulation of SOC and other important soil nutrients under organic and no-fertilizations, and correlated SOC with crop yields. Using data from long-term experimental study sites of semiarid in Tanzania, we estimated SOC accumulation in different soil treatments and depths where a total of 128 soil samples were collected at the depths of 0-20 cm and 20-40 cm from two villages (sites) with organic fertilization and nofertilization treatments. Sites under organic fertilization were defined as those which have received manure fertilization for more than 5 years on continuum basis. Outcomes: The accumulation of SOC was significantly greater in soils under organic fertilizations (1.15 and 0.80 MgC ha(-1) at soil depth and 20-40 cm) and decreased with increasing soil depths. Similarly, TN and P decreased from 0.40 and 2.40 Mg (0-20 cm) to 0.16 and 2.10 Mg (20-40 cm), respectively. Other important soil nutrients such as calcium (Ca2+), potassium (K+), magnesium (Mg2+), and sodium (Na+) had similar pattern. In addition, soil bulk density was less under organic fertilization (1.1 g/cm(3)) than under no-fertilization (1.2 g/cm(3)) and it increased with soil depths. Correspondingly, the crop yields were significantly higher (1.6 tn ha(-1)) under organic fertilizations than (0.6 tn ha(-1)) under no-fertilizations indicating that crop yields were significantly affected by SOC. Discussion: Organic fertilization i.e., especially cattle manure in the area has considerable fertility potential. To optimize soil fertility potential, we need to consider such kind of fertilization from household to national level. Conclusion: Our results demonstrated that manure application was the best fertilization method for improving soil fertility in most croplands of Tanzania's semiarid areas, especially in this era of climate change scenarios.",Tanzania,Tanzania,Tanzania,TRUE,,Finger Millet-Maize-Sorghum,maize,NA,FALSE,major,Organic Fertilizer,organic fertilizer,"organic fertilization, no-fertilization",Organic Fertilizers,TRUE,,TRUE,,Resilience,Physical,Soil Quality,"Soil Total Nitrogen, Soil Organic Carbon, Cation Exchange Capacity","soil organic carbon, total nitrogen, phosphorus, calcium, potassium, magnesium, sodium, soil bulk density, crop yields","Soil Organic Carbon, Soil Total Nitrogen","Soil Organic Carbon, Soil Total Nitrogen,yield",TRUE,,FALSE,major
AN0026,"The effects of a low-external-input soil fertility enhancement solution - hereafter termed 'nitrolimigation' were examined, as a preferred technique of applying nitrogen and calcium in the ""Acid Sands"" soils of southern Nigeria. Two types of nitrogenous fertilizer sources [urea and liquid pig manure (LPM)] and two types of lime limestone (CaCO3) and hydrated lime [Ca(OH)(2)] were used both in greenhouse and in field experiments at varying levels: Urea [CO (NH2)(2)] 0, 40, 50, 80, 100, 120, and 150kg ha(-1); lime 0, 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 1.0, 5.0, and 10.0 metric tonnes per hectare (t ha(-1)) and LPM 0, 30, 60, 90, and 120 t ha(-1).

EO0144,"With growing water shortages, agriculture faces the challenge of increasing water productivity (WP). In this work, WP of two main crops, peach and olive, is evaluated for different cultivars and deficit irrigation practices. WP in peach was estimated over 4-7 years for three cultivars (early, mid-season and late-maturing), two rootstocks and two deficit irrigation strategies. In terms of yield/total water supply, the late maturing cultivar subjected to mild deficit irrigation, gave the highest WP (4.1 kg m-3), compared to the mid-season (3.0 kg m-3) and early cultivar (1.9 kg m-3). Full irrigation reduced slightly the performance of the most productive cultivar (3.7 kg m-3). Performances of early and mid-season cultivars were affected by rootstock. Interaction between mild deficit irrigation and vigorous rootstock induced better WP. Experimental work in olives targeted WP under contrasted environments. In northern Tunisia (450 mm annual rainfall), average yield for three cultivars ('Picholine', 'Chetoui' and 'Mansanille') planted at 6x6 m spacing on a clay soil, varied between 3.9-4.7 and 4.7-6.1 t ha-1, respectively when irrigation was increased from 100 to 200 mm.

LM0210,"Water is the most limiting factor for plant production in arid to semiarid regions. In order to overcome this limitation surface runoff water can be used to supplement seasonal rainfall. During 1996 we conducted a runoff irrigated agroforestry field trial in the Turkana district of Northern Kenya. The effects of two different Acacia saligna (Labill.) H. Wendl. tree planting densities (2500 and 833 trees per ha), tree pruning (no pruning vs. pruning) and annual intercrops (no intercrop vs. intercrop:; Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench during the first season and Vigna unguiculata (L.) Walp. during the second season) on water use were investigated. The annual crops were also grown as monocrops. Water consumption ranged from 585 to 840 mm during the first season (only treatments including trees). During the second season, which was shorter and the plants relied solely on stored water in the soil profile, water consumption was less than half of that during the first season. Highest water consumptions were found for non-pruned trees at high density and the lowest were found for the annual crops grown as monocrops. Tree pruning decreased water uptake compared to non-pruned trees but soil moisture depletion pattern showed complementarity in water uptake between pruned trees and annual intercrops. The highest values of water use efficiency for an individual treatment were achieved when the pruned trees at high density were intercropped with sorghum (1.59 kg m(-3)) and cowpea (1.21 kg m(-3)). Intercropping and high tree density increased water use efficiency in our runoff agroforestry trial. We ascribe the observed improvement in water use efficiency to the reduction of unproductive water loss from the bare soil.",Kenya,Kenya,Kenya,TRUE,,"Sorghum, Cowpea","Sorghum bicolor,Vigna unguiculata","Sorghum bicolor,Vigna unguiculata",TRUE,,"Agroforestry Pruning-Alleycropping, Agroforestry Pruning-Alleycropping-Water Harvesting","agroforestry, water havesting","runoff irrigation, tree planting densities, tree pruning, intercropping",Intercropping,TRUE,minor,FALSE,minor,Resilience,"Efficiency, Physical","Efficiency, Soil Quality","Water Use, Soil Moisture, Water Use Efficiency","water consumption, water use efficiency, soil moisture depletion, water uptake","Water Use Efficiency, Water Use","Water Use Efficiency, Water Use",TRUE,,TRUE,
LM0333,"In the rainfed cropping systems of the semi-arid tropics where water supply is often limited and erratic, management practices should always be geared towards efficient utilisation of the water available for crop growth. This study aimed at evaluating the effects of genotype and phosphorus fertilizer rates on water use and water use efficiency of chickpea in the dry environments of Limpopo Province, South Africa. Field experiments were conducted during winter 2009 (Experiment I) and summer 2009/2010 (Experiment II) using a factorial treatment combination of 3 phosphorus (P) fertilizer rates (0 kg P ha-1 [low], 45 kg P ha-1[medium] and 90 kg P ha-1 [high]) and 4 chickpea genotypes (ICCV92944, ICCV3110, ICCV4306 and ICCV7307) arranged in a randomized complete block design with 3 replications. Crop evapotranspiration (ET) was determined by monitoring soil water content at 7-day intervals using a neutron probe, and water use efficiency was determined as a ratio of total crop biomass/grain yield to cumulative ET. Genotype and phosphorus application did not affect ET in both Experiment I and II. Genotype did not affect water use efficiency of biomass production (WUEb) in both experiments. In contrast, WUEb) increased with P rate in Experiment II. Similarly, water use efficiency of grain yield (WUEg) was greater at high (4.7 kg ha-1 mm-1) compared with medium (4.2 kg ha-1 mm-1) and low (3.0 kg ha-1 mm-1) P rate in Experiment II. WUEg varied from 1.33 kg ha-1 mm-1 (genotype ICCV4306) to 6.4 kg ha-1mm-1(ICCV92944) in Experiment I, and from 3.1 kg ha-1 mm-1 (ICCV92944) to 4.9 kg ha-1 mm-1 (ICCV4306) in Experiment II. Grain yield increased (P<0.001) with WUEg in both Experiment I (R2 = 0.94) and Experiment II (R2 = 0.99). Therefore use of management practices that enhance water use efficiency such as genotype selection and P fertilizer application may be immensely important in improving chickpea productivity in dry environments.",South Africa,South Africa,South Africa,TRUE,,Chickpea,chickpea,chickpea,TRUE,,Inorganic Fertilizer,,phosphorus application,phosphorus application,TRUE,,TRUE,,Resilience,"Efficiency, Physical","Efficiency, Soil Quality","Water Use, Soil Moisture, Water Use Efficiency","water use, water use efficiency, grain yield, evapotranspiration","Water Use, Water Use Efficiency, yield","Water Use, Water Use Efficiency, yield",TRUE,,TRUE,
